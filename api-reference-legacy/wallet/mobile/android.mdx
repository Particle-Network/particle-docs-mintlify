## Particle Wallet for Android

Particle Wallet is the primary interface outside of integrated applications for utilizing the account generated by Particle Auth or linked using Particle Connect. In short, Particle Wallet, for Android, is a standard wallet UI for sending, swapping, and purchasing cryptocurrency natively with your account (derived from a social login or Web3 wallet linkage). This wallet is highly customizable, meaning you can onboard users and facilitate interaction within your application while providing a shortcut to a customized instance of Particle Wallet.

Details regarding the programmatic usage of Particle Wallet **can be found below**.

---

## Getting Started

Particle Wallet, on mobile, is a complimentary SDK to Particle Connect, enabling the unified utilization of accounts within Particle Connect. To begin working with Particle Wallet on Android, you must go through a quick initial configuration process.

### Prerequisites

Before jumping in, several requirements are needed to avoid compatibility issues. Ensure your project meets or exceeds these minimum prerequisites before continuing.

- minSdkVersion **23** or higher.
- compileSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion **34** or higher.
- JavaVersion **17**.
- [Jetpack (AndroidX)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate?authuser=0).
- Android Gradle Plugin Version : 8.5.1 or higher.
- Gradle Version : 8.9 or higher.

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

Once your project meets the aforementioned requirements, you'll need to move onto retrieving three key (and universally required across all SDKs) values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

These are your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`. During configuration, you'll need these to connect your project with the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network), unlocking customization, analytics, tracking, etc.

<Note>
  Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys:
  [Create a new
  project](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/mobile-quickstart#configuring-particle-auth).
</Note>

### Configuration

With the dashboard setup, you'll also need to set up your `build.gradle` file to use the necessary dependencies. As mentioned, Particle Wallet is complimentary to Particle Connect, and thus, there are several requirements needed to use the wallet SDK, `network.particle:wallet-service`:

- Modules `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15to18` and `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on`.
- Particle Connect dependencies:
  - `network.particle:auth-core`.
  - `network.particle:connect`.
  - `network.particle:connect-auth-core-adapter`.
  - Other wallet adapters that you plan on using.
- Particle Wallet SDK, `network.particle:wallet-service`.

The latest versions for these SDKs can be found on [Maven](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:network.particle).

```groovy
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }
    // ...
}

dependencies {
  //required
   modules {
        module("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15to18") {
            replacedBy("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on")
        }
        module("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on") {
            replacedBy("org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on")
        }
    }

    implementation 'network.particle:connect:{latest-version}'

    implementation 'network.particle:connect-auth-core-adapter:${latest_version}'
 		// Other adapters, such as network.particle:connect-phantom-adapter

    implementation 'network.particle:api-service:${latest_version}'
    implementation 'network.particle:wallet-service:${latest_version}'
    // ...
}
```

## Examples of Utilization

### Initialization

Before you can use the full extent of the Particle Wallet SDK, you'll need to initialize `ParticleWallet` (imported from `com.particle.gui.ParticleWallet`) with `ParticleWallet.init`. Additional methods won't function until this happens. This method, `init`, takes a number of optional parameters:

- `supportChains`, an array of `ChainInfo` objects dictating the chains available within the Particle Wallet interface.
- `setShowTestNetworks`, whether or not test networks (Testnets) should be shown within the chain selection menu on Particle Wallet. This takes one parameter, `true` or `false` (`false` by default).
- `setShowManageWalletSetting`, whether or not the "Manage Wallet" button within the Particle Wallet interface is shown. This takes one parameter, `true` or `false` (`true` by default).
- `hideMainBackIcon`, removes the "Back" icon on the main wallet page.
- `setShowAppearanceSetting`, if the appearance (dark/light mode) setting is shown and available to the user. It takes one parameter, `true` or `false` (`true` by default).
- `setSupportDappBrowser`, whether or not the dApp browser is available within the wallet interface (custom browser instance using the account as a connection mechanism with dApps). It takes one parameter, `true` or `false` (`true` by default).
- `setWalletIcon`, the icon/logo shown within the wallet interface. It takes one parameter, a string representing an icon URL.

E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
ParticleWallet.init(
    context,
    supportChains,
).apply {
  setShowTestNetworkSetting(true) // Default is false
  setShowManageWalletSetting(true) // Default is true
  hideMainBackIcon() // Hide the back icon in the main page
  setShowAppearanceSetting(true) // Default is true
  setShowLanguageSetting(true) // Default is true
  setSupportDappBrowser(true) // Default is true
  setWalletIcon("https://xxx.xxx/xxx.png") // Set the wallet icon
}
```

### Custom Wallet UI

Once initialization is complete, you can apply additional customizations and configurations to Particle Wallet.

The first of these is the ability to apply initialization configurations (such as `setShowTestNetworkSetting`) after initial configuration through methods such as `ParticleWallet.showTestNetworks()`, `ParticleWallet.hideManageWallet()`, and so on.

Additionally, if you'd like to use a custom wallet within the Particle Wallet interface (for example, a wallet name, network, etc., specific to your project), then you'll need to use `WalletInfo.createWallet` to create a custom wallet object. This takes the following parameters:

| Field       | Type   | Description                                                                                         |
| :---------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| address     | String | The user's public address belonging to the current active session (connected via Particle Connect). |
| chainName   | String | The name of the chain to be used within Particle Wallet.                                            |
| chainId     | Long   | The ID of the chain to be used within Particle Wallet                                               |
| walletName  | String | The name of your wallet/project to be shown in UI.                                                   |
| adapterName | String | The name of the wallet adapter you're using (such as `MobileWCWalletName.AuthCore.name`).  |

Saving this as an object, you can pass it into `ParticleWallet.setWallet`, changing the active interface/wallet according to the parameters outlined within `WalletInfo.createWallet`. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
// Post-initialization configuration
ParticleWallet.showTestNetworks()
ParticleWallet.hideManageWallet()

// Custom wallet configuration
val yourWalletName = "Your Wallet"
val wallet = WalletInfo.createWallet(
  ParticleNetwork.getAddress(),
  ParticleNetwork.chainInfo.name,
  ParticleNetwork.chainInfo.id,
  1,
  yourWalletName,
  MobileWCWalletName.Particle.name
)

ParticleWallet.setWallet(wallet)


// If you'd like, you can set your custom localizable string
// Overlay strings.xml
YourProject/app/src/main/res/
  values/strings.xml
  values-ja-rJP/strings.xml
  values-ko-rKR/strings.xml
  values-zh-rCN/strings.xml
  values-zh-rHK/strings.xml
  values-zh-rTW/strings.xml

// Reassign a value
<string name="pn_network_fee">new NetworkFee</string>
<string name="pn_particle_auth_wallet">New Wallet</string>
```

### Set Wallet

Before open a wallet, you need to set up a wallet, When you log in using [connect](/api-reference/connect/mobile/android/), a wallet information will be returned. You can directly use the SDK method to set it

```kotlin kotlin
        adapter.connect(null, object : ConnectCallback {
            override fun onConnected(account: Account) {
                lifecycleScope.launch {
                    ParticleWallet.setWallet(account.publicAddress, adapter)
                    PNRouter.build(RouterPath.Wallet).navigation()
                }
            }
            override fun onError(error: ConnectError) {}
        })
```

### Open Wallet

`PNRouter`, imported from `com.particle.gui.router.PNRouter`, can be used to programmatically open different components of Particle Wallet. To open the main wallet interface (the page displaying address, balance, tokens, and buttons leading to other pages), you'll need to call `PNRouter.build`, passing in `RouterPath.Wallet` (in which `RouterPath` is imported from `com.particle.gui.router.RouterPath` and dictates the page, or path, to be opened), then calling `navigation`. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
PNRouter.build(RouterPath.Wallet).navigation()
```

### Open Send Token

To open the page coordinating sending a token (**token referring to either native tokens or ERC20/SPL tokens**), you can call `PNRouter.build`, passing in `RouterPath.TokenSend`. If you're sending an ERC20/SPL token, you'll need to fill in `params`- a `WalletSendParams` object (imported from `com.particle.gui.ui.send.WalletSendParams`) containing the following:

- `tokenAddress`, the address of the token to be sent (required).
- `toAddress`, the recipient address (optional).
- `toAmount`, the amount to be sent (optional).

Otherwise, passing `RouterPath.TokenSend` alone without `params` will open the same page with the native token of the network selected.

```kotlin Kotlin
val params = WalletSendParams(tokenAddress, toAddress?, toAmount?)
PNRouter.build(RouterPath.TokenSend, params).navigation()

PNRouter.build(RouterPath.TokenSend).navigation()
```

### Open Receive Token

A page displaying both the user's address and an associated QR code can be opened through `PNRouter.build`, using `RouterPath.TokenReceive`. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
PNRouter.build(RouterPath.TokenReceive).navigation()
```

### Open Transaction Records

Transaction records (history) for ERC20/721 tokens, along with native tokens, can be programmatically opened through `PNRouter.build`, using `RouterPath.TokenTransactionRecords`. If you're specifically looking for a given token, you'll also need to use `params`, a `TokenTransactionRecordsParams` object (imported from `com.particle.gui.ui.token_detail.TokenTransactionRecordsParams`) containing a given `tokenAddress`. Otherwise, `RouterPath.TokenTransactionRecords` can be used on its own. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
val params = TokenTransactionRecordsParams(tokenAddress)
PNRouter.build(RouterPath.TokenTransactionRecords, params).navigation()

PNRouter.build(RouterPath.TokenTransactionRecords).navigation()
```

### Open NFT Details

Particle Wallet also natively supports viewing specific NFTs (traits, description, image, etc.). Forcing this menu programmatically can happen through `PNRouter.build`, passing both `RouterPath.NftDetails` and `params`, a `NftDetailsParams` object (imported from `com.particle.gui.ui.nft_detail.NftDetailParams`) containing a `tokenAddress` (address of the ERC721 token), and the `recipientAddress` (owner of the NFT). E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
var params = NftDetailParams(tokenAddress, recipientAddress)
PNRouter.build(RouterPath.NftDetails, params).navigation()
```

### Open Buy Crypto

Particle Wallet also has a native onramp aggregator, allowing users to bring fiat on-chain through various onramp providers. Opening this programmatically can happen through `ParticleNetwork.openBuy`, passing in several **optional** parameters to customize the values used within the onramp. Upon calling, this will throw a popup or total redirect over to a configuration of https://ramp.particle.network.

The specific parameters that can be used within `ParticleNetwork.openBuy` are listed below:

| Name          | Description                                                              | Type   | Required                                 |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| network       | [Solana, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Tron, Optimism, etc.].  | string | False _(True if Particle not connected)_ |
| fiatCoin      | Fiat currency denomination.                                              | string | False                                    |
| cryptoCoin    | Cryptocurrency denomination.                                             | string | False                                    |
| fiatAmt       | The amount of fiat to be automatically filled in as the purchase volume. | number | False                                    |
| bool          | Lock fiat currency in the buy menu.                                      | bool   | False                                    |
| fixCryptoCoin | Lock cryptocurrency in the buy menu.                                     | bool   | False                                    |
| fixFiatAmt    | Lock fiat amount in the buy menu.                                        | bool   | False                                    |
| walletAddress | The wallet address to receive the cryptocurrency.                        | string | False _(True if Particle not connected)_ |

```kotlin Kotlin
ParticleNetwork.openBuy(
  walletAddress: String? = null,
  amount: Int? = null,
  fiatCoin: String = "usd",
  cryptoCoin: String = "eth",
  fixFiatCoin: Boolean = false,
  fixFiatAmt: Boolean = false,
  fixCryptoCoin: Boolean = false,
  theme: String = "light",
  language: String = "en-us",
  chainName: String? = null
)
```

### Open Swap

Particle Wallet has built-in swap functionality (retrieves multiple quotes from different providers such as 1inch, iZUMi, etc., routing the swap through the best one depending on swap rate) for Mainnets (both Solana and EVM). Opening this menu can be done through `PNRouter.navigatorSwap`, which alone will open the default swap menu without values filled in. However, you can pass in a `SwapConfig` object (`swapConfig` in this example), imported from `com.particle.gui.ui.swap.SwapConfig`, containing:

- `fromTokenAddress`, the token to swap from.
- `toTokenAddress`, the token to swap to.
- `fromTokenUIAmount`, the amount of `fromTokenAddress` to be automatically reflected within the UI.

E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
PNRouter.navigatorSwap()

val swapConfig = SwapConfig(
  fromTokenAddress="",
  toTokenAddress="",
  fromTokenUIAmount="0.1"
)
PNRouter.navigatorSwap(swapConfig)
```

### Open DApp Browser Page

Particle Wallet also includes a dApp Browser, allowing users to open different dApps (web apps) and automatically connect with the account loaded into the instance of Particle Wallet, enabling account usage across any dApp. This can be programmatically opened through either `PNRouter.navigatorDappBrowser`, taking one parameter, `url`, which will dictate the specific site opened, or `ParticleNetwork.navigatorDAppBrowser`, which takes the same parameter. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
PNRouter.navigatorDappBrowser(url:String)

// Alternatively
ParticleNetwork.navigatorDAppBrowser(url:String)
```

## Relevant API Methods, Examples

In addition to methods through `ParticleWallet` and `PNRouter` that control Particle Wallet, it's also worth mentioning a few APIs that can be accessed through `ParticleNetwork` , which may be relevant to Particle Wallet.

### Get Price

To retrieve the price of one or multiple tokens, you can call the `getPrice` method on either `ParticleNetwork.evm` or `ParticleNetwork.solana`, both taking `addresses` (either a singular or list of token addresses --for the native token, use `'native'`), and `currencies` (either a singular or list of fiat currencies in which the prices are denominated (such as `['usd', 'cny']`). E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
ParticleNetwork.solana.getPrice(addresses, currencies)

ParticleNetwork.evm.getPrice(addresses, currencies)
```

### Tokens by Address

You can also retrieve the tokens belonging to a specified address by calling either `getTokensAndNFTs` or `getTokensAndNFTsFromDB` (retrieves exclusively from DB) on `ParticleNetwork.solana` or `ParticleNetwork.evm`, taking one parameter, the `address` of the account being queried. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
ParticleNetwork.solana.getTokensAndNFTs(address)

ParticleNetwork.solana.getTokensAndNFTsFromDB(address)

ParticleNetwork.evm.getTokensAndNFTs(address)

ParticleNetwork.evm.getTokensAndNFTsFromDB(address)
```

### Transaction History by Address

The full transaction history of a given address can be retrieved through either `getTransactionsByAddress` or `getTransactionsByAddressFromDB` (pulls data exclusively from DB) on `ParticleNetwork.solana` or `ParticleNetwork.evm`. Both of these take `address` (the user address to be queried), although `ParticleNetwork.solana` also takes an additional optional object, which in this example is `optBody`. This can contain additional parameters, such as the boolean, `parseMetadataUri`. E.g.:

```kotlin Kotlin
ParticleNetwork.solana.getTransactionsByAddress(address, optBody)

ParticleNetwork.solana.getTransactionsByAddressFromDB(address, optBody)

ParticleNetwork.evm.getTransactionsByAddress(address)

ParticleNetwork.evm.getTransactionsByAddressFromDB(address)
```
