## Particle Wallet For Unity

Particle Wallet, within Unity applications, acts as a unified interface for both Web2 (via social login) and Web3 (via external wallets) accounts, working directly with Particle Connect. Particle Wallet on Unity provides games with a standard UI (yet customizable) UI for sending, swapping, and purchasing cryptocurrency natively within a corresponding account. Because of this, Particle Wallet is best described as wallet infrastructure, not a standalone wallet.

Details regarding the configuration and utilization of the Particle Wallet Unity SDK **can be found below**.

## Repository

Before diving in, all of the Particle Network Unity SDKs (for Particle Auth, Particle Connect, and Particle Wallet) are publicly available and viewable through the [official repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity). Feel free to look at the underlying architecture and demos showcasing end-to-end implementation for an initial understanding of working with Particle Wallet on Unity.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To start, your Unity project must meet several requirements to avoid compatibility issues. These requirements will be, in some capacity, dependent on the platform that you've decided to use. They are as follows:

- **Unity 2022.3.43f1** or higher.
- If you're using iOS:
  - **Xcode 15.0** or higher.
  - **CocoaPods 1.14.3** or higher.
  - **iOS 14** or higher.
- If you're using Android:
  - minSdkVersion **23** or higher.
  - compileSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion **34** or higher.
  - JavaVersion **17**.
  - [Jetpack (AndroidX)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate?authuser=0).
  - Android Gradle Plugin Version : 8.5.1 or higher.
  - Gradle Version : 8.9 or higher.

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

Once you've ensured your project meets the above prerequisites, you'll also need three key values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`.

These directly connect your Unity project with the Particle dashboard, enabling customization, analytics, tracking, etc.

<Note>
  Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys:
  [Create a new
  project](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/mobile-quickstart#configuring-particle-auth).
</Note>

### Configuration

With these values retrieved, you can move on to initial configuration and dependency management. This will vary in complexity depending on the platform in question. To begin, for both iOS and Android, you'll need to download and install the Particle Unity package.

Head over to the [`particle-unity` GitHub repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/releases), and download the latest release (`.unitypackage`), then import this into your project.

#### iOS configuration

If you're building a Unity game on iOS, you must follow a specific configuration process to ensure that Particle Wallet functions. The first step within this process is to set up a scheme URL within the Unity editor.

1. Head into the [iOS Player Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsiOS.html) menu (`Edit` -> `Project Settings` -> `Player Settings` -> `iOS`).
2. From here, select `Other`, then scroll down to `Configuration`.
3. Open the `Supported URL schemes` section, and within the `Element 0` field, paste in your `projectId` with a prefix of `pn`.  
   For example, if your `projectId` (from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network)) is something like `63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, then the scheme URL, in this case, would be `pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`.

<Note>
  <p>Remove other services, if needed</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    Within `ParticleNetworkIOSBridge.cs`, you'll have a number of services
    included in the SDK:
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- `ParticleNetworkBase` - required universally.</p>
  <p>- `ParticleAuthCore` - required for Particle Auth Core.</p>
  <p>- `ParticleConnect`- required for Particle Connect.</p>
  <p>
    - `ParticleWalletGUI` - usage of the Particle Wallet UI, contains all
    services.
  </p>
  <p>- `ParticleAA` - usage of the Particle AA, contains all services.</p>
</Note>

You'll also need to configure your Podfile if you haven't already. If you don't have a Podfile, go to the root of your project directory and run `pod init`to generate one.

Open this Podfile, and insert the specific pods (services) you'd like to use within your project. In this case, `ParticleWalletGUI` will generally suffice, but additional services can be added if needed.

Additionally, you'll need to paste in the below code snippet for installation handling:

```ruby Podfile
pod 'ParticleWalletGUI'
// Also include:
pod 'SkeletonView', :git => 'https://github.com/SunZhiC/SkeletonView.git', :branch => 'main'
pod 'SwiftyUserDefaults', :git => 'https://github.com/SunZhiC/SwiftyUserDefaults.git', :branch => 'master'
pod 'WalletConnectSwiftV2', :git => 'https://github.com/SunZhiC/WalletConnectSwiftV2.git', :branch => 'particle'

// Paste this
post_install do |installer|
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
  target.build_configurations.each do |config|
  config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
 end
```

Also you can copy the example [Podfile](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/blob/main/ios-build/Podfile) .

With your Podfile set, you'll need to run `pod install` and open your `.xcworkspace` file, as shown below:

```shell Terminal
pod install --repo-update

open {your project}.xcworkspace
```

Finally, for iOS, you'll need to use the `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` previously retrieved. To do this, head into the root of your Xcode project and create a file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Within this file, paste the following text, then replace the placeholders:

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### Android configuration

Alternatively, if you're building your Unity game for Android, you'll just need to configure two files before you're ready. The first of these two files can be found at `Assets/Plugins/Android/launcherTemplate.gradle` within your project. Here, you'll need to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies included.

You'll need the following dependencies at a minimum:

- `network.particle:wallet-service`, required for Particle Wallet.
- `network.particle:auth-service`, if you're planning on using Particle Auth directly.
- `network.particle:connect`, if you're planning on using Particle Connect directly.
- `network.particle:unity-bridge`, required universally.

```groovy launcherTemplate.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation project(':unityLibrary')
    implementation "network.particle:wallet-service:${sdkVersion}"
    implementation "network.particle:unity-bridge:${sdkVersion}"
  	// Other dependencies
}
```

Finally, for Android, you'll need to place your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` within `gradleTemplate.properties`, found at `Assets/Plugins/Android/gradleTemplate.properties`.

```groovy gradleTemplate.properties
particle.network.project_client_key=Your Client Key
particle.network.project_id=Your Project ID
particle.network.app_id=Your App ID
```

With all of this set up, you can now drag the `ParticleWalletGUI.prefab` file into your first scene.

---

## Examples of Utilization

### Initialization

With your Unity project configured and ready to go, you'll need to do one more thing before the full extent of the SDK is available: initialization. `ParticleWalletGUI` will need to be initialized before Particle Wallet will work properly.

To do this, you'll need to call `ParticleWalletGUI.ParticleWalletConnectInitialize`, passing in `metadata`, which contains the following:

- `walletConnectProjectId`, your WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com).
- `name`, the name of your project.
- `icon`, a URL linking to the icon/logo of your project - ideally 512x512.
- `url`, the URL of your project's website.
- `description`, a short description of your project.
- Optionally, `redirect` and `verifyUrl` can also be added.

Additionally, if you're using `ParticleNetwork` and `ParticleConnectInteraction` for Particle Connect or Auth, you can initialize them in the same place and using the same `metadata`.

```csharp
var metadata = new DAppMetaData(TestConfig.walletConnectProjectId, "Particle Connect",
    "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png",
    "https://connect.particle.network", "Particle Unity Demo");

ParticleNetwork.Init(ChainInfo.Ethereum);
ParticleConnectInteraction.Init(ChainInfo.Ethereum, metadata);
ParticleWalletGUI.ParticleWalletConnectInitialize(metadata);
```

### Customization

Now that `ParticleWalletGUI` is initialized and set to go, you can move onto configuring and customizing the wallet interface itself, choosing the specific options that are enabled and disabled within the wallet, the language used, and more. This can be done through `ParticleWalletGUI.{configuration method}`. The specific methods available here include the following:

- `SetSupportChain`, sets the array of supported blockchain networks. It accepts an array of chain information, with the default being all chains.

- `SetPayDisabled`, toggles the ability to perform buy transactions within the interface. It takes a Boolean, `true` or `false`, with no default value specified.

- `SetShowTestNetwork`, controls the visibility of the test network. It accepts a Boolean value, `true` or `false`.

- `SetShowManageWallet`, determines whether the manage wallet page is displayed. It takes a Boolean parameter, `true` or `false`.

- `SetDisplayTokenAddresses`, specifies which token addresses are displayed, filtering out others. It accepts an array of token addresses to be displayed.

- `SetDisplayNFTContractAddresses`, sets specific NFT contract addresses to be displayed, hiding others. It takes an array of NFT addresses.

- `SetPriorityTokenAddresses`, prioritizes certain tokens to be shown at the top of the list. It accepts an array of token addresses.

- `SetPriorityNFTContractAddresses`, sets certain NFTs to appear at the top of the list. It requires an array of NFT addresses. Similar to `SetPriorityTokenAddresses`.

- `SetSupportAddToken`, toggles the display of the add token button in the main wallet page. It takes a Boolean value, `true` or `false`.

- `SetSupportWalletConnect`, controls support for wallet connect as a wallet option. It accepts a Boolean value, `true` or `false`.

- `SetSupportDappBrowser`, determines whether the dApp browser should be shown on the wallet page. It takes a Boolean parameter, `true`, or `false`.

- `SetShowLanguageSetting`, controls the visibility of the language setting button in the settings page. It accepts a Boolean parameter, either `true` or `false`.

- `SetShowAppearanceSetting`, toggles the display of the appearance setting button in the settings page. It takes a Boolean value, `true` or `false`.

E.g.:

```csharp
ParticleWalletGUI.SetSupportChain(new []{chainInfo});

ParticleWalletGUI.EnablePay(false);

ParticleWalletGUI.SetShowTestNetwork(false);

ParticleWalletGUI.SetShowManageWallet(false);

ParticleNetwork.SetAppearance(UserInterfaceStyle.DARK);

ParticleWalletGUI.SetDisplayTokenAddresses(new []{"Your token address"});
ParticleWalletGUI.SetDisplayNFTContractAddresses(new []{"Your NFT address"});

ParticleWalletGUI.SetPriorityTokenAddresses(new []{"Your token address"});
ParticleWalletGUI.SetPriorityNFTContractAddresses(new []{"Your NFT address"});

ParticleWalletGUI.SetSupportAddToken(false);

ParticleWalletGUI.SetSupportWalletConnect(false)

ParticleWalletGUI.SetSupportDappBrowser(false)

ParticleNetwork.SetFiatCoin("HKD");

ParticleNetwork.SetLanguage(Language.KO);

ParticleWalletGUI.SetShowLanguageSetting(true);

ParticleWalletGUI.SetShowAppearanceSetting(true);
```

### Open Wallet

Within `ParticleWalletGUI`, you can also force specific pages of Particle Wallet to open, passing in specific preset configurations. In this case, you can programmatically open the main page of the wallet with `NavigatorWallet` and pass in a binary (`0` or `1`), indicating whether the main page should display ERC20/SPL tokens (`0`), or NFTs (`1`). E.g.:

```csharp
int display = 0;
ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorWallet(display);
```

### Open Receive Token

Similarly, you can open a standalone page for receiving cryptocurrency. This'll include the user's address alongside a corresponding QR code. To do this, you'll need to call `ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorTokenReceive`. If you'd like, you can pass in a specific `tokenAddress` to create a token-specific QR code, including its icon/logo at the center. E.g.:

```csharp
ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorTokenReceive();
ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorTokenReceive(tokenAddress);
```

### Open Send Token

To open the token sending page (ERC20/SPL/native), you'll can use `ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorTokenSend`, optionally passing in various parameters such as `tokenAddress`, `toAddress`, and `amount` to predefine values within the interface. E.g.:

```csharp
ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorTokenSend(tokenAddress, toAddress, amount);
```

### Open Transaction Records

You can also return a page displaying the transaction records of a connected wallet, `ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorTokenTransactionRecords`, which optionally takes one parameter, `tokenAddress`, for filtering the results only to include transactions that involve a specified ERC20/721 token address. E.g.:

```csharp
ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorTokenTransactionRecords(tokenAddress);
```

### Open NFT Send

Similar to the token sending page, you can also return an NFT sending page for moving (sending) a specific NFT to a different address. This can be done through `ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorNFTSend`, taking:

| Field            | Type      | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mint`           | `string`  | (`contractAddress`) of a given NFT.                                                                      |
| `tokenId`        | `string`  | The token ID of an NFT (within the collection defined by `mint`). This can be left as `null` for Solana. |
| `receiveAddress` | `string?` | The recipient address, a blank string by default.                                                        |
| `amount`         | `string?` | The volume of NFT (`mint`) to be sent, ERC172 NFT should set 1                                           |

E.g.:

```csharp
ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorNFTSend(contractAddress, tokenId, null, null);
```

### Open NFT Details

Particle Wallet also natively supports viewing specific NFTs (traits, description, image, etc.). Forcing this menu programmatically can happen through `ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorNFTDetails`, passing in the `contractAddress` of the NFT and the specific `tokenId`. For Solana, `tokenId` can be left blank. E.g.:

```csharp
ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorNFTDetails(contractAddress, tokenId);
```

### Open Buy Crypto

Particle Wallet also has a native onramp aggregator, allowing users to bring fiat on-chain through various onramp providers. Opening this programmatically can happen through `ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorBuyCrypto`, passing in several optional parameters to customize the values used within the onramp. Upon calling, this will throw a popup or total redirect over to a corresponding configuration of https://ramp.particle.network.

The specific parameters that can be used within `ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorBuyCrypto` are listed below:

| Field           | Type                    | Description                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WalletAddress` | `string?`               | (Optional) The wallet address to receive the cryptocurrency, default is current user address. |
| `ChainInfo`     | `ChainInfo?`            | (Optional) The chainInfo, default is current chainInfo.                                       |
| `CryptoCoin`    | `string?`               | (Optional) Cryptocurrency denomination. Default is current chain native token symbol.         |
| `FiatCoin`      | `String?`               | (Optional) Fiat currency denomination. Default is current fiat coin.                          |
| `FiatAmt`       | `int?`                  | (Optional) The amount of fiat to be automatically filled in as the purchase volume.           |
| `FixFiatCoin`   | `bool`                  | (Optional) Lock selection of fiat coin in the buy menu, default is false.                     |
| `FixCryptoCoin` | `bool`                  | (Optional) Lock selection of fiat amount in the buy menu, default is false.                   |
| `Theme`         | `Theme?`                | (Optional) The buy page theme, `Dark` or `Light`, default is false.                           |
| `Language`      | `Language?`             | (Optional) The buy page lanuage, default is current language.                                 |
| `modalStyle`    | `iOSModalPresentStyle?` | (Optional) Control iOS presentation style, default is `PageSheet`.                            |

```csharp
BuyCryptoConfig config = new BuyCryptoConfig(TestAccount.EVM.PublicAddress,
                             OpenBuyNetwork.BinanceSmartChain, "BNB", "USD", 100);
ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorBuyCrypto(config);

ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorBuyCrypto();
```

### Open Swap

Additionally, Particle Wallet has a built-in swap functionality (retrieves multiple quotes from different providers such as 1inch, iZUMi, etc., routing the swap through the best one) for Mainnets (Solana and EVM). Throwing this menu can be done through `ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorSwap`, which alone will open the default swap menu without values filled in, although you can pass in several optional parameters, including:

| Field              | Type                   | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fromTokenAddress` | `string`               | (Optional) the swap pair from token address                                                                                                            |
| `toTokenAddress`   | `string`               | (Optional) the swap pair to token address                                                                                                              |
| `amount`           | `string`               | (Optional) the swap from token amount, should pass the minimal unit string, for example 0.01 ETH, it's decimals is 18, should pass "10000000000000000" |
| `modalStyle`       | `iOSModalPresentStyle` | (Optional) control iOS presentation style, default is `PageSheet`.                                                                                     |

E.g.:

```csharp
ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorSwap();

ParticleWalletGUI.NavigatorSwap(fromTokenAddress, toTokenAddress, fromTokenAmount);
```

### Switch Wallet

Finally, before opening the UI, if you'd like to switch the `WalletType` (`walletType` in this case) reflected and used within the wallet itself, you can use `ParticleWalletGUI.Instance.SwitchWallet`, passing in the specific `walletType` (see [Particle Connect iOS](https://particlenetwork.readme.io/reference/ios-swift) for more information) and targeted user address, `publicAddress`. E.g.:

```csharp
var walletType = WalletType.MetaMask;
var nativeResultData = await ParticleWalletGUI.Instance.SwitchWallet(walletType, publicAddress);
```
