## Particle Auth within Web3-Onboard

Built by Blocknative, Web3-Onboard is a widely used framework-agnostic connection kit providing rich account interfaces, transaction data, and diverse wallet support. Particle Auth is natively supported within Web3-Onboard through `@web3-onboard/particle-network`, allowing social logins to be seamlessly included within an instance of Web3-Onboard, as is shown in the embedded demo below.

## Leveraging `@web3-onboard/particle-network`

Web3-Onboard's native Particle Auth integration allows a derivative of `ParticleNetwork` from `@particle-network/auth` to be configured and defined within `Onboard` from `@web3-onboard/core`.

Therefore, implementation of Particle Auth is straightforward, following the same configuration and initialization process as `@particle-network/auth`. The following steps facilitate this process:

1. **Configure `particleModule` from `@web3-onboard/particle-network`**. After installing `@web3-onboard/particle-network` and importing `particleModule`, you'll need to define an instance using an object containing the following properties.
   - `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`. These are required values representing a project and application made through the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).
   - Optionally, `wallet` can be defined, which contains:
     - `displayWalletEntry`, a Boolean determining whether or not the embedded wallet modal is shown upon login (`true` by default).
     - `defaultWalletEntryPosition`, a string defining the position in which the embedded wallet modal will initially appear if `displayWalletEntry` is `true`.
   - Optionally, `preferredAuthType` can be defined to shortcut your instance of Particle Auth to a specific social login mechanism. This parameter contains:
     - `type`, the specific social login type you'd like to be used. This should be one of the following:
       - `'email'`
       - `'phone'`
       - `'facebook'`
       - `'google'`
       - `'apple'`
       - `'twitter'`
       - `'discord'`
       - `'github'`
       - `'twitch'`
       - `'microsoft'`
       - `'linkedin'`
       - `'jwt'`
         - Alternatively, the above can be represented through `AuthType.google`, `AuthType.email`, etc., which can be imported from `@particle-network/auth-core`.
     - `setAsDisplay`, a Boolean determining if the social login mechanism chosen within `type` will be represented within the Web3-Onboard interface (for example, changing the wallet option to "Google" rather than the default value of "Particle Network").  
       Below is an example of what a configured instance of `particleModule` may look like:
   ```typescript typescript
   const particle = particleModule({
       projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID!,
       clientKey: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_KEY!,
       appId: process.env.REACT_APP_APP_ID!,
       preferredAuthType: { type: 'google', setAsDisplay: true },
   })
   ```
2. **Initialize Web3-Onboard through `Onboard`**. With an instance of `particleModule` prepared, you're ready to configure `Onboard` from `@web3-onboard/core`. `Onboard` takes the following parameters.
   - `wallets`, an array of initialized wallet modules. Your instance of `particleModule` should go here. For a complete list of compatible wallet modules, head over to the [Web3-Onboard documentation](https://onboard.blocknative.com/docs/overview/introduction).
   - `chains`, an array of chain objects representing the blockchains you intend to use within your application. Each of these objects should contain:
     - `id`, (chain ID).
     - `token` (ticker).
     - `label` (name).
     - `rpcUrl`  
       Thus, initializing Web3-Onboard (`Onboard`) may look like the following snippet.
   ```typescript typescript
   const onboard = Onboard({
       wallets: [particle],
       chains: [
         {
           id: '0x1',
           token: 'ETH',
           label: 'Ethereum Mainnet',
           rpcUrl: 'https://eth.llamarpc.com'
         },
         {
           id: '0x2105',
           token: 'ETH',
           label: 'Base',
           rpcUrl: 'https://mainnet.base.org'
         }
       ]
   })
   ```
3. **Initiate wallet connection and EIP-1193 provider extraction**. Opening the Web3-Onboard connection modal can be done by simply calling `{your Onboard instance}.connectWallet()`. This will return an object containing an associated EIP-1193 provider, which can then be used for configuration within a library such as Ethers, Web3.js, viem, etc. An example of this has been included below:

   ```typescript typescript
   const wallet = await onboard.connectWallet()

   const customProvider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(wallet[0].provider, "any");
   ```
