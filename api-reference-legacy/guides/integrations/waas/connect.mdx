<Tip>
If you're looking for the best SDK to use for a general implementation of Particle Network, you're in the right place.
</Tip>

Particle Connect exists as the all-in-one SDK driving implementation of Particle Network's Wallet Abstraction stack, aggregating both social logins through [Particle Auth](/guides/integrations/waas/auth) and standard wallet connection.

Particle Connect is an in-house connection modal and component enabling users to connect with dApps through either Web2-based accounts or Web3-native wallets (such as MetaMask, Phantom, etc.). Whether a user would like to login through a social account, or through their MetaMask wallet, Particle Connect exists to be the singular interface facilitating both of these methods of connecting to a dApp.

In this sense, Particle Connect can be best described as an SSO for Web3, offering a strong method of onboarding users regardless of their comfort level or personal integration within Web3. This ultimately lowers the entry barrier within applications without resulting in a clunky experience for Web3-native users; instead, the experience is standardized across both mediums.

## Integrating Particle Connect

Using Particle Connect as a means of wallet connection within your application is quite straightforward and supported across several different platforms and frameworks. Whether you're building a web or mobile application or a game, Particle Connect has over seven SDKs to enable this integration. To understand the basics of working with Particle Connect programmatically, go to the [Particle Connect](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/connect/web-quickstart) quickstart guide.
