## SDKs with Cocos Support

Particle Network supports Cocos (Cocos2d) natively. Currently, SDK support for Cocos is limited to JavaScript/TypeScript within the standard Particle Auth SDK. Like Unreal Engine, Particle Auth alone is plenty to facilitate end-to-end integration of Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service directly within your application built using Cocos. 

You can find the up-to-date integration guide through the card below or explore the [`particle-cocos` GitHub repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-cocos/tree/mobile).
