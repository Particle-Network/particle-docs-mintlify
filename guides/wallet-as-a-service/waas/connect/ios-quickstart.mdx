# Quickstart: Implementing Particle Connect within iOS Applications

Getting started with Particle Connect on iOS only takes a few minutes.

Below is a quick, step-by-step rundown on installing, configuring, and utilizing Particle Connect on iOS.

<Note>
  For complete documentation covering the implementation of Particle Connect on iOS in more depth, head over to the [iOS SDK reference](/api-reference/connect/mobile-sdks/ios).
</Note>

---

To begin, you'll need to ensure that your project meets the following requirements (if it doesn't, you may encounter compatibility issues).

### Prerequisites

- **Xcode 15.0** or higher.
- **CocoaPods 1.14.3** or higher.
- **iOS 14** or higher.

---

<Steps>

<Step title="Installing Particle Connect">

Once you've ensured that your project meets the aforementioned prerequisites, you'll need to install Particle Connect and various associated SDKs, including:
- `ParticleConnectKit`
- `ParticleConnect`
- `ConnectCommon`
- `ParticleAuthCore`
- `ParticleMPCCore`
- `Thresh`
- `AuthCoreAdapter`
- For EVM, `ConnectWalletConnectAdapter`
- For Solana, `ConnectPhantomAdapter`
- Optionally, `ParticleWalletAPI`
- Optionally, `ParticleWalletGUI`
- Optionally, `ParticleWalletConnect`

The following snippet should be included within your Podfile (with or without the optional libraries).

```ruby Podfile
pod `ParticleConnectKit`
pod 'ParticleConnect'
pod 'ConnectPhantomAdapter'
pod 'ConnectWalletConnectAdapter'
pod 'ConnectCommon'
pod `ParticleAuthCore`
pod 'ParticleMPCCore'
pod 'Thresh'
pod 'AuthCoreAdapter'

pod 'ParticleWalletAPI' #Optional, for create transaction
pod `ParticleWalletGUI` #Optional, for wallet
pod 'ParticleWalletConnect' #Optional, for wallet
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configuring Particle Connect">

Once installed, you're ready to configure the SDK.

To configure, and eventually initialize Particle Connect, you'll need three key values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your project ID, client key, and app ID. These authenticate your instance of Particle Connect and connect your project to the dashboard.

To retrieve these values, follow the steps below:

/>
</div>
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

For more information on the Particle dashboard, take a look at the [dashboard quickstart](/guides/dashboard).

With your project ID, client key, and app ID retrieved, you'll add a file named `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` to your project, then insert these values as is shown below.

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
    <string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string> <!-- Replace this with your project ID -->
    <key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
    <string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string> <!-- Replace this with your client key -->
    <key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
    <string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string> <!-- Replace this with your app ID -->
</dict>
</plist>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configuring Xcode">

Finally, before initializing and using the SDK, you'll need to configure your `Info.plist` file; this file should contain an array of strings representing the wallets you intend to support, alongside a number of permissions, as is shown below.

```xml Info.plist
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
<string>metamask</string>
<string>phantom</string>
<string>bitkeep</string>
<string>imtokenv2</string>
<string>rainbow</string>
<string>trust</string>
<string>zerion</string>
<string>mathwallet</string>
<string>oneinch</string>
<string>awallet</string>
<string>okex</string>
<string>bnc</string>
</array>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access in order to open photos of barcodes</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use the camera to scan barcodes</string>
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use Face ID for secure access to the app.</string>
```

Additionally, you'll need to add your scheme URL to your Xcode project.

For example, if your `appId` is `63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, then the scheme URL would be `pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, simply adding `pn` to the beginning of the `appId`.

</Step>

<Step title="Initialize SDK">

Before using Particle Connect, you'll need to initialize the SDK through the `initialize` method on `ParticleConnect`, which takes the following parameters:
- `env`, representing the mode in which you'd like your environment to be in, such as `.debug`, `.staging`, or `.production`. This primarily affects the amount of information logged during usage.
- `chainInfo`, specifying the primary chain you intend to use within your application.
- `dAppData`, the metadata used for WalletConnect.
- `adapters`, an array of adapters representing the wallets you'd like to support within your application.

Additionally, you can set specific chains to be used within WalletConnect (`chainInfo` structures) with `setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos`. An example of this can be found below.

```swift
var adapters: [ConnectAdapter] = [
    AuthCoreAdapter(),
    // Select the third-party wallet you want from the options below. 
    WalletConnectAdapter(),
    MetaMaskConnectAdapter(),
    PhantomConnectAdapter(),
    ImtokenConnectAdapter(),
    BitgetConnectAdapter(),
    RainbowConnectAdapter(),
    TrustConnectAdapter(),
    ZerionConnectAdapter(),
    MathConnectAdapter(),
    Inch1ConnectAdapter(),
    ZengoConnectAdapter(),
    AlphaConnectAdapter(),
    OKXConnectAdapter()
    ]

// You can retrieve chainInfo from ChainInfo, the initialize works for the first time open.
// If you support more than one chain, you can use ParticleNetwork.setChainInfo to switch.
ParticleConnect.initialize(env: .debug, chainInfo: ChainInfo.ethereumSepolia, dAppData: .standard, adapters: adapters)

// Optional, for usage of Particle Wallet
ParticleWalletConnect.initialize(
        WalletMetaData(name: "Particle Wallet",
                        icon: URL(string: "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png")!,
                        url: URL(string: "https://particle.network")!,
                        description: "Particle Connect is a decentralized wallet connection protocol that makes it easy for users to connect their wallets to your DApp.", redirectUniversalLink: nil)
    )
ParticleWalletGUI.setAdapters(adapters)

ParticleWalletGUI.setShowTestNetwork(true)

// Set walletConnect connection chains, but metamask doesn't support more than one chain one connection.
ParticleConnect.setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos([.ethereum, .bnbChain])
```

</Step>

<Step title="Facilitating connection">

Now that Particle Connect has been installed, configured, and initialized, you're ready to facilitate connection through the Particle Connect modal.

To do this, you'll need to establish a `config` specifying the:
- Onboarding mechanisms you'd like to support, through `connectOptions` (such as `.email`, `.phone`).
- Social login providers you'd like to support, through `socialProviders` (such as `.google`, `.apple`).
- Wallets you'd like to be included as options within the modal, through `walletProviders` (specified through an instance of `EnableWalletProvider`, as shown below).
- (Optionally), layout options altering the format of the connection modal through `additionalLayoutOptions`.
- (Optionally), additional customizations, such as a custom icon, through `designOptions`.

Upon generating this config (with `ConnectKitConfig`), you'll be able to call `ParticleConnectUI.connect`, initiating the resulting connection modal.

```swift
let connectOptions: [ConnectOption] = [.email, .phone, .social, .wallet]
let socialProviders: [EnableSocialProvider] = [.google, .apple]
let walletProviders: [EnableWalletProvider] = [EnableWalletProvider(name: "metamask", state: .recommended), EnableWalletProvider(name: "okx", state: .popular), EnableWalletProvider(name: "walletConnect", state: .none)]
let additionalLayoutOptions = AdditionalLayoutOptions(isCollapseWalletList: false, isSplitEmailAndSocial: false, isSplitEmailAndPhone: false, isHideContinueButton: false)
// If you'd like to specify an icon, you can do so through a local image, base64 string or url.
let designOptions: DesignOptions = .init(icon: ImagePath.local(UIImage(named: "icon")!))
let config = ConnectKitConfig(connectOptions: connectOptions, socialProviders: socialProviders, walletProviders: walletProviders, additionalLayoutOptions: additionalLayoutOptions, designOptions: designOptions)

let account = try await ParticleConnectUI.connect(config: config).value 
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Examples of Utilization

### Retrieving User Information

Upon wallet connection (or social login), you'll be able to retrieve information about the resulting account.

Basic account information can be found through the result of `ParticleConnectUI.connect`, in this case, that was saved to `account`, which contains properties such as `publicAddress` and `walletType`.

To explicitly retrieve `userInfo` (a collection of information regarding the login mechanism, attached addresses, and so on; more information can be found within its [API reference](/api-reference/auth/server/getuserinfo)), you'll need to call `auth.getUserInfo`.

An example of both approaches can be found below.

```swift
let publicAddress = account.publicAddress
let walletType = account.walletType

// If you're using account abstraction (through ParticleAA), you'll need to retrieve the user's address through the following:
let smartAccountAddress = account.smartAccount?.smartAccountAddress

if account.walletType == WalletType.authCore {
    let auth = Auth()
    let userInfo = auth.getUserInfo()
}
```

### Send a Transaction

Sending a transaction using the resulting account follows a similar process to other mobile SDKs. A basic transaction will need to be constructed using `ParticleWalletAPI.evm().createTransaction`, this takes basic parameters such as `from`, `to`, `value`, and (optionally) `data` and returns a machine-readable transaction object.

To execute the resulting transaction, you'll need to initialize an instance of the active connected wallet; an example of doing this has been included in the snippet below.

Finally, using this instance, the transaction can be executed through `{adapter}.signAndSendTransaction`, taking the sender's address alongside the previously constructed transaction object.

```swift
let adapter = ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters().first {
      $0.walletType == account.walletType
}

let receiverAddress = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
let value = BDouble(0.000000001 * pow(10, 18)).rounded().toHexString()
let transaction = try await ParticleWalletAPI.evm().createTransaction(from: account.publicAddress, to: receiverAddress, value: value, data: "0x").value

// Got this transaction hash                
let txHash = try await adapter!.signAndSendTransaction(publicAddress: account.publicAddress, transaction: transaction).value
```

### Open Wallet

If you included `ParticleWalletGUI` within your Podfile, you can open the (optional) embedded wallet interface at any time after a user connects, use `ParticleWalletGUI.setSupportChain` to set supported chains, then `PNRouter` to open the interface.

```swift
ParticleWalletGUI.setSupportChain(Set<[ChainInfo.ethereum, ChainInfo.bnbChain]>)
PNRouter.navigatorWallet(hiddenBackButton: false)
```


<Tip> To implement account abstraction within your iOS project, integrate the `ParticleAA` SDK and refer to this [documentation](/api-reference/aa/sdks/mobile/ios). Additionally, a demo repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-connect-ios/tree/master/ConnectKitDemo). </Tip>
