# Quickstart: Implementing Particle Connect within applications built with Flutter

Particle Connect is the flagship SDK driving one-click onboarding through either social logins or standard wallet connection; in just a few minutes, Particle Connect can be implemented to offer a unified modal for bringing users into your dApp.

This document will go through the step-by-step process of configuring, initializing, and using Particle Connect with Flutter.

<Note>
  For complete documentation covering the implementation of Particle Connect on Flutter in more depth, head over to the [Flutter SDK reference](/api-reference/connect/mobile/flutter).

<Steps>

<Step title="Installing Particle Connect">

To start, you'll need to add `particle_connect` to your Flutter application; this will need to be done before moving onto platform-specific configuration.

```shell Terminal
flutter pub add particle_connect
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configuring Particle Connect">

After adding and installing the SDK, you're ready to move onto configuration; this will differ depending on the platform you intend on using (iOS or Android).

But beforehand, you'll need to retrieve three key values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your project ID, client key, and app ID. These are used to authenticate your instance of Particle Connect and connect your project to the dashboard; these are required to properly initialize the SDK, regardless of platform.

To grab these keys, follow the steps outlined below:

### Android

If you're planning on using Android for your React Native application, ensure you meet the following prerequisites (otherwise, expect compatibility issues):

#### Prerequisites

- minSdkVersion **23** or higher.
- compileSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion **34** or higher.
- JavaVersion **17**.
- [Jetpack (AndroidX)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate?authuser=0).
- Android Gradle Plugin Version: **8.5.1** or higher.
- Gradle Version: **8.9** or higher.

To configure Particle Connect and prepare for initialization, you can begin by going ahead and opening your `build.gradle` file, often found at the following file path: `${project name}/android/app/build.gradle`

Within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to add four new lines to ensure Particle Connect runs properly:

1. `minSdkVersion`. In most cases, this will be set to `23`.
2. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"]`, the project ID previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
3. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"]`, the client key previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
4. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"]`, the app ID previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.

An example of this has been included below.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
defaultConfig {
  applicationId "com.example.particle_auth_test"

  minSdkVersion 23 // Required
  targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion
  versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
  versionName flutterVersionName

  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"] = "YOUR PROJECT ID"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"] = "YOUR CLIENT KEY"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"] = "YOUR APP ID"
}
```

Additionally, staying within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to ensure that you're using version 17 of Java in both `compileOptions` and `kotlinOptions`, alongside enabling `dataBinding`.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
compileOptions {
  sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
  targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}

kotlinOptions {
  jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_17.toString()
}

dataBinding {
  enabled = true
}
```

---

### iOS

Before beginning, ensure your project meets the following prerequisites:

- **Xcode 15.0** or later.

- **iOS 14** or later.

With these requirements set, you'll need to open an exported iOS project and find `ios/{project name}.xcworkspace`.

<Steps>
  <Step title = "Configuring ParticleNetwork-info.plist">
    At the root of your Xcode project, create a new file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` . Ensure this is marked under "Target Membership."

    From here, with a fresh `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file, go ahead and fill it in with the values previously retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network):

    ```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
      <key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
      <string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
      <key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
      <string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
      <key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
      <string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
    </dict>
    </plist>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title ="Configuring AppDelegate.swift">
    Next, you'll need to head over to your `AppDelegate.swift` file to add an import of `ParticleConnect`.

    ```dart
    import ParticleConnect
    ```

    Within your application's `application` method (as shown below), you'll need to include a handler condition derived from `ParticleConnect.handleUrl`. This should be as simple as a `true` return upon a truthy value of `ParticleConnect.handleUrl`, and a `super.application(app, open: url, options: options)` return upon a falsy value.

    ```dart
    override func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
      if ParticleConnect.handleUrl(url) {
          return true
      } else {
          return super.application(app, open: url, options: options)
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setting your scheme URL">
    Additionally, you'll need to configure your application's scheme URL. To configure this, select your application from "TARGETS" under the "Info" section, then click "+" to add a URL type.

    For example, if your `appId` is `63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, then the scheme URL would be `pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f` --simply adding `pn` to the beginning of the `appId`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuring Info.plist">
    Now, head over to your `Info.plist` file and include the following snippet:

    ```xml Info.plist
    <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
    <array>
    <string>metamask</string>
    <string>phantom</string>
    <string>bitkeep</string>
    <string>imtokenv2</string>
    <string>rainbow</string>
    <string>trust</string>
    <string>zerion</string>
    <string>mathwallet</string>
    <string>oneinch</string>
    <string>awallet</string>
    <string>okex</string>
    <string>bnc</string>
    </array>
    <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
    <string>We need access in order to open photos of barcodes</string>
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>We use the camera to scan barcodes</string>
    <key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
    <string>We use Face ID for secure access to the app.</string>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuring your Podfile">
    Finally, you'll need to edit your Podfile to ensure `particle_connect` is properly imported. Head over to the [linked guide](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-flutter/blob/master/particle-connect/example/ios/Podfile) to complete this if you haven't already.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
<p>Another important note before continuing.</p>
<p>Our SDK is a static library (XCFramework). When using the Particle Auth Flutter SDK, you'll need to specify that you're using a static framework through the following:</p>
<p>

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
end
```

</p>
</Note>

</Step>


<Step title="Initializing Particle Connect">

Having now installed and configured Particle Connect, the only step remaining before the SDK can be used is initialization.

Particle Connect can be initialized by simply calling the `init` method on `ParticleConnect`. This takes the following parameters:
  - `chainInfo`, representing the primary chain you intend to use (for example, `ChainInfo.Ethereum`, `chainInfo.Polygon`).
  - `dappMetaData`, derived from `DappMetaData`
  - `env`, affecting the information logged within your environment (`Env.dev`, `Env.production`, or `Env.staging`).

The snippet below is an example of this.

```dart
final dappInfo = DappMetaData(
    "Particle Connect",
    "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png",
    "https://connect.particle.network",
    "Particle Connect Flutter Demo");
// Initialize ParticleConnect and ParticleAuthCore.
ParticleConnect.init(currChainInfo, dappInfo, Env.dev);
ParticleAuthCore.init();
```

</Step>

<Step title="Facilitating connection">

Now that Particle Connect has been installed, configured, and initialized, you're ready to facilitate connection through the Particle Connect modal.

To do this, you'll need to establish a `connectKitConfig` instance specifying the:
- Onboarding mechanisms you'd like to support, through `connectOptions` (such as `.EMAIL`, `.PHONE`, `SOCIAL`, `WALLET`).
- Social login providers you'd like to support, through `socialProviders` (such as `.GOOGLE`, `.APPLE`).
- Wallets you'd like to be included as options within the modal, through `walletProviders` (specified through an instance of `EnableWalletProvider`, as shown below).
- (Optionally), layout options altering the format of the connection modal through `additionalLayoutOptions`.
- (Optionally), additional customizations, such as a custom icon, through `logo`.

Upon generating this config (with `ConnectKitConfig`), you'll be able to call `ParticleConnect.connectWithConnectKitConfig`, initiating the resulting connection modal.

```dart
final config = ConnectKitConfig(
  logo: "", // base64 or image URL
  connectOptions: [
    ConnectOption.EMAIL,
    ConnectOption.PHONE,
    ConnectOption.SOCIAL,
    ConnectOption.WALLET,
  ], // Changing the order will alter the UI
  socialProviders: [
    EnableSocialProvider.GOOGLE,
    EnableSocialProvider.TWITCH,
    EnableSocialProvider.APPLE,
    EnableSocialProvider.DISCORD,
    EnableSocialProvider.TWITTER,
    EnableSocialProvider.FACEBOOK,
    EnableSocialProvider.GITHUB,
    EnableSocialProvider.MICROSOFT,
    EnableSocialProvider.LINKEDIN,
  ], // Changing the order will alter the UI
  walletProviders: [
    EnableWalletProvider(EnableWallet.MetaMask,
        label: EnableWalletLabel.RECOMMENDED),
    EnableWalletProvider(EnableWallet.OKX),
    EnableWalletProvider(EnableWallet.Trust,
        label: EnableWalletLabel.POPULAR),
    EnableWalletProvider(EnableWallet.Bitget),
    EnableWalletProvider(EnableWallet.WalletConnect),
  ], // Changing the order will alter the UI
  additionalLayoutOptions: AdditionalLayoutOptions(
    isCollapseWalletList: false,
    isSplitEmailAndSocial: true,
    isSplitEmailAndPhone: false,
    isHideContinueButton: false,
  ),
);

final account = await ParticleConnect.connectWithConnectKitConfig(config);
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Examples of Utilization

### Retrieving User Information

Upon wallet connection (or social login), you'll be able to retrieve information about the resulting account.

Basic account information can be found through the result of `ParticleConnect.connectWithConnectKitConfig`, in this case, that was saved to `account`, which contains properties such as `publicAddress` and `walletType`.

To explicitly retrieve `userInfo` (a collection of information regarding the login mechanism, attached addresses, and so on; more information can be found within its [API reference](/api-reference/auth/server/getuserinfo)), you'll need to call `ParticleAuthCore.getUserInfo`.

An example of both approaches can be found below.

```dart
const publicAddress = account.publicAddress
const walletType = account.walletType

if (walletType.toLowerCase() == "authCore") {
  final userInfo = await ParticleAuthCore.getUserInfo();
}
```

### Send a Transaction

To do this, you'll need to construct a transaction with `EvmService.createTransaction` using standard parameters such as `evmAddress` (from, or the sender), `data`, `value`, and `receiverAddress` (to, or the recipient),

To execute the resulting transaction, you'll need to initialize an instance of the active connected wallet; an example of doing this has been included in the snippet below.

Finally, using this instance, the transaction can be executed through `ParticleConnect.signAndSendTransaction`, taking the sender's address alongside the previously constructed transaction object.

```dart
final evmAddress = account.publicAddress;
const receiverAddress = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
final value = BigInt.from(0.000000001 * pow(10, 18));
const data = "0x";

final transaction = await EvmService.createTransaction(evmAddress, data, value, receiverAddress);
String txHash = await ParticleConnect.signAndSendTransaction(WalletType.authCore, account.publicAddress, transaction);
```

### Open Wallet

If you included `particle_wallet` within your `pubspec.yaml`, you can open the (optional) [embedded wallet interface](/api-reference/wallet/mobile/flutter) at any time after a user connects, use `ParticleWallet.setSupportChain` to set supported chains, then `ParticleWallet.navigatorWallet` to open the interface.

```dart
List<ChainInfo> chainInfos = [
  ChainInfo.Ethereum,
  ChainInfo.Polygon,
  ChainInfo.BNBChain
];
ParticleWallet.setSupportChain(chainInfos);
ParticleWallet.navigatorWallet();
```

<Tip> To implement account abstraction within your Flutter project, integrate the `particle_aa` SDK and refer to this [documentation](/api-reference/aa/sdks/mobile/flutter). Additionally, a demo repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-flutter/tree/master/particle-aa/example). </Tip>
