## Quickstart: Implementing Smart Wallet-as-a-Service within Telegram Mini-Apps

Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service (MPC-based wallets alongside account abstraction) natively supports integration within Telegram Mini-apps, using a users Telegram account to create and use an embedded wallet.

Getting up and running with Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service within your Telegram Mini-app takes less than 5-minutes.

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on setting up [Particle Auth](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/auth) in a Telegram Mini-app, enabling you to leverage features like social logins, smart accounts, and gasless transactions. 

<Note>Note that due to limitations of Telegram's in-app browser (WebView), only email login, SMS login, and embedded wallets are supported within Telegram mini-apps.</Note>

For detailed documentation on Particle's various SDKs, refer to the ["SDKs and APIs" pages](/api-reference/introduction).


## Guide 1: Using the starter repository

<Tip>This is the fastest and recommended way to start.</Tip>

<Steps>

<Step title="Set up a Telegram Bot and Mini-app">


Before you begin, you must create a Telegram Bot and Mini-app.

Follow this [comprehensive guide](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/platform/creating-new-app) to set them up. You can pause at [the step where a URL is required](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/platform/creating-new-app#web-application-link), as you'll need to deploy your app first.


</Step>

<Step title="Clone and set up the TG Mini-app starter">

The fastest way to set up a Telegram Mini-app with Particle is to use the [starter repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter). This repository provides a pre-configured Telegram Mini-app that already includes the Particle Wallet and Account Abstraction functionality, providing a straightforward foundation for building your own Mini-app.

To get started, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter.git
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh Terminal
yarn
```

This will initialize a Telegram Mini-app with the following features:

- **Technology Stack**:
  - [@telegram-apps/create-mini-app](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/packages/telegram-apps-create-mini-app)
  - Next.js
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - [Particle Auth SDK](/docs/building-with-particle-auth)
  - [Particle AA SDK](/reference/introduction-to-smart-waas)
  - ethers.js

- **Main Features**:
  - **User Authentication**: Seamless login using Telegram through Particle Auth.
  - **Wallet Information Display**: Wallet information is loaded and displayed in-app.
  - **Gasless Transactions**: To exemplify the possible functionality here between Particle Auth and its AA SDK, users can send gasless transactions of native tokens to any address.

</Step>

<Step title="Mini-app development">

To start developing your Telegram Mini-app, it's essential to understand the key files in the project. These files form the backbone of the app's structure and are where you will make customizations and add new features:

- **[/src/components/Root/index.tsx](https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter/blob/main/src/components/Root/index.tsx)**: The `Root` component establishes the main environment for the app by configuring Particle Auth, binding theme and viewport CSS variables, and managing application states through nested providers and hooks. 
    <Tip>Edit this file to customize the Particle Auth configuration and modify global app settings.</Tip>

- **[/src/app/layout.tsx](https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter/blob/main/src/app/layout.tsx)**: This file defines the root layout of the Telegram Mini-app, setting global metadata, applying styles, and ensuring a responsive design by wrapping the app's content in the `Root` component with proper viewport configuration.

- **[/src/components/Home/index.tsx](https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter/blob/main/src/components/Home/index.tsx)**: The `Home` component manages the user interface, handling wallet connections, initializing smart accounts, and navigating through tabs.
    <Tip>This is where you configure the Smart Account settings (such as the type of account contract, [the supported chains](/guides/network-coverage), and so on), customize the app's header, and manage interactive components within the tabs.</Tip>

- **[/src/components/EVMDemo/index.tsx](https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter/blob/main/src/components/EVMDemo/index.tsx)**: In this demo, the `EVMDemo` component enables users to interact with EVM-compatible blockchains via a smart account, making gasless native token transfers ([Solana is also supported](https://github.com/Particle-Network/auth-tg-miniapp/blob/main/src/components/SolanaDemo/index.tsx), just not by default within this starter).
    <Tip> Modify this file to add new features or change how blockchain interactions are displayed, as it is imported into the `Home` component's tabs.</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Configuring Particle Auth">

Particle Auth requires three key values to be initiated: `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`. These values link your Telegram Mini-app with the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/).

To retrieve these values for configuration within your application, follow these steps:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Access the Particle Dashboard">

Sign up or Log in into the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/)

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/images/login.png"
  alt="Login into Particle."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/images/login.png"
  alt="Login into Particle."
/>
</div>
 </Accordion>
<Accordion title="Create a new project or enter an existing project">
<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/images/project.png"
  alt="Create Particle project."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/images/project.png"
  alt="Create Particle project."
/>
</div>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a new Telegram application, or skip this step if you already have one">
<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/images/tg-project.png"

/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/images/tg-project.png"
  alt="Create Telegram app."
/>
</div>

Here you will add the TG Bot Username and Telegram Bot API Token you received from the previous set up using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Retrieve the project ID (`projectId`), the client key (`clientKey`), and the application ID (`appId`)">
<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  className="block h-64 dark:hidden"
  src="/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Find app's credentials."
/>
<img
  className="hidden h-64 dark:block"
  src="/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/images/credentials.png"
  alt="Find app's credentials."

</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>For more information on the Particle dashboard, take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7DYCMNDmjo&ab_channel=ParticleNetwork) or visit the [dashboard quickstart](/guides/dashboard)</Tip>

Once you have retrieved your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`, add them to a `.env` file located in the root of your project with the following content:

```sh .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='PROJECT_ID'
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY='CLIENT_KEY'
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID='APP_ID'
```

</Step>

<Step title="Run the Mini-app">

Although it is possible to run the application outside of Telegram, it is recommended to develop it within Telegram for the most accurate representation of its real-world functionality.

To run the application inside Telegram, [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) requires an exposed link. Deploy the app in Vercel or expose your HTTP development server using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

If you use Ngrok, run the application locally with:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Now you can use the URL of your app to complete the configuration from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) (as a reminder, you can now return to [this step](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/platform/creating-new-app#web-application-link) from the Telegram documentation).

## Guide 2: Start from scratch

This section provides guidance on how to start building your own Telegram Mini-app from scratch.

### Create a Mini-app

To create a new Mini-app, use the [@telegram-apps/create-mini-app](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/packages/telegram-apps-create-mini-app) package. This starter project is built with the default options along with Next.js integration.

### Install Additional Packages

Install the required packages using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @particle-network/aa @particle-network/auth-core-modal blo ethers framer-motion sonner eruda
```

### Add Context Directory

Create a `context` directory in the `src` folder and add an `index.tsx` file. You can find the code for this file in the [starter repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter/blob/main/src/context/index.tsx).

### Configure Particle Auth

In the `components/Root` directory, rename your main component file to `index.tsx`. Configure the `AuthCoreContextProvider` to wrap the `AppProvider` as follows:

```tsx
<AuthCoreContextProvider
  options={{
    projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID as string,
    clientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY as string,
    appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID as string,
    themeType: "dark",
    // Define UI elements for the smart account
    erc4337: {
      name: "SIMPLE",
      version: "2.0.0",
    },
    wallet: {
      themeType: "dark",
      customStyle: {
        // Locks the chain selector to IoTeX mainnet and testnet
        supportChains: [EthereumSepolia, BaseSepolia],
        dark: {
          colorAccent: "#7DD5F9",
          colorPrimary: "#21213a",
          colorOnPrimary: "#171728",
          primaryButtonBackgroundColors: ["#5ED7FF", "#E89DE7"],
          primaryIconButtonBackgroundColors: ["#5ED7FF", "#E89DE7"],
          primaryIconTextColor: "#FFFFFF",
          primaryButtonTextColor: "#0A1161",
          cancelButtonBackgroundColor: "#666666",
          backgroundColors: [
            "#14152e",
            [
              ["#e6b1f766", "#e6b1f700"],
              ["#7dd5f94d", "#7dd5f900"],
            ],
          ],
          messageColors: ["#7DD5F9", "#ed5d51"],
          borderGlowColors: ["#7bd5f940", "#323233"],
          modalMaskBackgroundColor: "#141430b3",
        },
      },
    },
  }}
>
  <Toaster
    /* This component displays notifications. */
    richColors
    position="top-left"
    expand={false}
    closeButton
    duration={2000}
  />
  <AppProvider>
    <div className="box-border w-screen">{props.children}</div>
  </AppProvider>
</AuthCoreContextProvider>
```

<Note>You can find the complete implementation of the `Root` component in the [starter repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter/blob/main/src/components/Root/index.tsx).</Note>

### Build the Mini-app

Edit the `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files in the `src/app` directory to reflect the reference files in the [starter repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter/tree/main/src/app).

Once configured, create a `Home` component to implement your Mini-app.

#### Example Implementation (AA)

The Particle Network AA SDK allows you to set up and configure smart accounts. Here's an example:

```tsx
import { SmartAccount } from '@particle-network/aa';
import { useEthereum } from "@particle-network/auth-core-modal";
import { BaseSepolia } from '@particle-network/chains';

const { provider } = useEthereum();

// Set up and configure the smart account
const smartAccount = new SmartAccount(provider, {
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!,
  clientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID!,
  aaOptions: {
    accountContracts: {
      SIMPLE: [
        {
          version: '2.0.0',
          chainIds: [BaseSepolia.id],
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

In this setup:

- **SmartAccount**: This class is used to create a smart account utilizing an instance of `SimpleAccount`.
- **aaOptions**: This field specifies the version and chain IDs for the account contracts, allowing you to configure the smart account with specific blockchain settings. Here, we're using version `2.0.0` of SimpleAccount and targeting the `Base` testnet (Sepolia) chain.

<Note>Find the full implementation of the `Home` component and set up in the [starter repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/tg-miniapp-particle-starter/blob/main/src/components/Home/index.tsx).</Note>
