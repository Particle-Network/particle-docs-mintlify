## Understanding Particle Auth

Particle Auth is the **core infrastructure component powering social logins** within Particle's Wallet Abstraction stack.

While Particle Auth is a standalone service, meaning it can be used solely as an isolated product for implementing social logins. It's also commonly used as **an infrastructural component driving social login within other Particle Network products** such as [Particle Connect](/guides/integrations/waas/connect), Particle's [RainbowKit](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/connection-kits/rainbow) integration, etc.

Particle Auth uses **MPC-TSS** (Multi-Party Computation with Threshold-Signature-Schemes) to generate non-custodial wallets derived from social accounts. Upon logging in with a given social login mechanism, a key pair is generated and secured through MPC-TSS, splitting it into multiple shares to be used for distributed signature generation. Upon using the key pair for a signature, each share (for most implementations, these will be two, one accessible locally/through a backup system, the second within a TEE) participates in the generation of a signature, thus resulting in the ability to authenticate signatures without the unification of a whole private key. For more information on MPC-TSS, look at [Security (MPC-TSS)](/landing/wallet-abstraction/waas/mpc-tss).

Particle Auth enables a **natural** (and customizable) flow from social login to account generation and, ultimately, authentication (signature generation), allowing for a **Web2-adjacent user experience**, abstracting away the typical seed-phrase management convention.

## Integrating Particle Auth

Adding Particle Auth to an application can happen through various mechanisms, largely dependent on your specific platform. Particle Auth has SDKs spanning **three desktop and seven mobile platforms**. This means that, regardless of where or how your application is built, you're likely using a stack compatible with Particle Auth.

To begin diving into the specifics of integrating Particle Auth within your platform of choice, choose the corresponding SDK reference from the cards below, or take a look at [Web (Desktop) Quickstart](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/auth/web-quickstart) and [Mobile (Android/iOS) Quickstart](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/mobile-quickstart) for technical overviews of the integration process.

To learn more about the degree to which you can customize Particle Auth, go to [Particle Auth](/guides/configuration/appearance/auth).

<Note> 
Most commonly, Particle Auth will be used through the means of Particle Connect and its all-in-one onboarding modal (aggregating both social logins through Particle Auth and standard wallet connection); you can learn more about this approach [here](/guides/integrations/waas/connect).
