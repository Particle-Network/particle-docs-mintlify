## SDKs with React Native Support

Particle Network has **JavaScript-based SDKs for React Native within each of it's major products**: **Particle Auth**, **Particle Connect**, and **Particle Wallet**. React Native is also supported within Particle Network's AA SDK, although this is currently undergoing a revamp to bring it up to the same modular standard as the other platforms supported by Particle's AA SDK.

React Native presents itself as a popular and **solid choice for building mobile applications in a familiar environment**; this familiarity extends directly to implementing React Native SDKs for each of Particle's products. For product-specific rundowns, choose from the cards below.
