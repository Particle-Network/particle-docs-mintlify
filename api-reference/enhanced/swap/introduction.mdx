1. If you're swapping `from` an ERC-20 token, you'll need to check token approval with `checkApprove`. If approval doesn't meet your requirements for the swap, you'll need to request approval.
2. Get a quote for the swap with `getQuote`.
3. Retrieve the swap transaction object with `getSwap`.
4. Execute the swap transaction.

<Tip>Native tokens, such as ETH, are represented as `0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee`</Tip>
