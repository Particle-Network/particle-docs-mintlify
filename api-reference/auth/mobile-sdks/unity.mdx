## Particle Auth for Unity (Mobile)

In addition to the Windows/macOS Unity SDK, Particle Auth also extends to standard Unity for Mobile platforms (through C#). This SDK includes all the standard functions required for initializing and interacting with Particle Auth to craft a Web2-adjacent onboarding flow within your Unity games.

Instructions setting up, and a rundown of some common functions and examples are covered below.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Your Unity project needs to meet several requirements to avoid any compatibility issues. These requirements will be, in some capacity, dependent on the platform that you've decided to use. They are:

- **Unity 2022.3.43f1** or higher.
- If you're using iOS:
  - **Xcode 15.0** or higher.
  - **CocoaPods 1.14.3** or higher.
  - **iOS 14** or higher.
- If you're using Android:
  - minSdkVersion **23** or higher.
  - compileSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion **34** or higher.
  - JavaVersion **17**.
  - [Jetpack (AndroidX)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate?authuser=0).
  - Android Gradle Plugin Version : 8.5.1 or higher.
  - Gradle Version : 8.9 or higher.

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

Once you've ensured that your project meets the above prerequisites, you'll also need three key values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`.

These connect your Unity project with the Particle dashboard, enabling customization, analytics, tracking, etc.

<Note>
  Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys:
  [Create a new
  project](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/mobile-quickstart#configuring-particle-auth).
</Note>

### Configuration

With these values retrieved, you can move on to initial configuration and dependency management. This will vary in complexity depending on the platform in question. To begin, you'll need to download and install the Particle Unity package, which includes the necessary files for both Particle Connect and Particle Auth.

Head over to the [`particle-unity` GitHub repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/releases), and download the latest release (`.unitypackage`), then import it into your project.

#### iOS configuration

If you're building a Unity game on iOS, you must follow a specific configuration process to ensure that Particle Connect functions. The first step within this process is to set up a scheme URL within the Unity editor.

1. Head into the [iOS Player Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsiOS.html) menu (`Edit` -> `Project Settings` -> `Player Settings` -> `iOS`).
2. From here, select `Other`, then scroll down to `Configuration`.
3. Open the `Supported URL schemes` section, and within the `Element 0` field, paste in your `projectId` with a prefix of `pn`.
   1. For example, if your `projectId` (from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network)) is something like `63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, then the scheme URL would be `pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`.

<Note>
  <p>Remove other services, if needed</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    Within `ParticleNetworkIOSBridge.cs`, you'll have a number of services
    included in the SDK:
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- `ParticleNetworkBase` - required universally.</p>
  <p>- `ParticleAuthCore` - required for Particle Auth Core.</p>
  <p>- `ParticleConnect`- required for Particle Connect.</p>
  <p>
    - `ParticleWalletGUI` - usage of the Particle Wallet UI, contains all
    services.
  </p>
  <p>- `ParticleAA` - usage of the Particle AA, contains all services.</p>
</Note>

You'll also need to configure your Podfile if you haven't already. If you don't have a Podfile, go to the root of your project directory and run `pod init`, which will generate a Podfile.

<Note>
  <p>Copy our example Podfile</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    You can copy our example
    [Podfile](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/blob/main/ios-build/Podfile),
    it will always use the latest version.
  </p>
</Note>

Open this Podfile, and insert the specific pods (services) you'd like to use within your project. In this case, `ParticleConnect` and `CommonConnect` will generally suffice, but additional services can be added if needed.

Additionally, you'll need to paste the code snippet below for installation handling:

```groovy Podfile
  # Particle Network Base
  pod 'ParticleNetworkBase', '1.4.10'

  # Particle Connect Service
  pod 'ConnectCommon', '0.2.26'
  pod 'ConnectEVMAdapter', '0.2.26'
  pod 'ConnectSolanaAdapter', '0.2.26'
  pod 'ConnectWalletConnectAdapter', '0.2.26'
  pod 'ConnectPhantomAdapter', '0.2.26'
  pod 'ParticleConnect', '0.2.26'

  # Particle Wallet Service
  pod 'ParticleWalletConnect', '1.4.10'
  pod 'ParticleWalletAPI', '1.4.10'
  pod 'ParticleWalletGUI', '1.4.10'

  # Particle AA
  pod 'ParticleAA', '1.4.10'

  # Particle Auth Core
  pod 'AuthCoreAdapter', '1.4.10'
  pod 'ParticleAuthCore', '1.4.10'
  pod 'ParticleMPCCore', '1.4.10'
  pod 'Thresh', '1.4.10'

  pod 'SkeletonView', :git => 'https://github.com/SunZhiC/SkeletonView.git', :branch => 'main'
  pod 'SwiftyUserDefaults', :git => 'https://github.com/SunZhiC/SwiftyUserDefaults.git', :branch => 'master'
  pod 'WalletConnectSwiftV2', :git => 'https://github.com/SunZhiC/WalletConnectSwiftV2.git', :branch => 'particle'

// Paste this
post_install do |installer|
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
  target.build_configurations.each do |config|
  config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
 end
```

Also you can copy the example [Podfile](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/blob/main/ios-build/Podfile) .

With your Podfile set, you'll need to run `pod install` and open your `.xcworkspace` file, such as is shown below:

```shell Terminal
pod install --repo-update

open {your project}.xcworkspace
```

Finally, for iOS, you'll need to formally use the `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` previously retrieved. To do this, head into the root of your Xcode project and create a file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Within this file, paste the following text (then replace the placeholders):

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Follow the steps to configure your Xcode workspace.

1.  Download `UnityManger.swift`, `Unity-iPhone-Bridging-Header.h` and `AppDelegate.swift` from under github [/Assets/Plugins/iOS/.Swift](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/tree/main/Assets/Plugins/iOS/.Swift) , Copy files into the root of your Xcode project. Xcode will ask you if auto create Bridging file, click yes.

    <img
      className="block dark:hidden"
      src="/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/images/unity-config.png"
      alt="Particle Network Unity config."
    />
    <img
      className="hidden dark:block"
      src="/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/images/unity-config.png"
      alt="Particle Network Unity config."
    />

2.  Make sure Build Settings, Swift Compiler - General, has Objective-C Bridging Header, its connect is Unity-iPhone-Bridging-Header.h 's local path.

        <img

    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/images/unity-configure-2.png"
    alt="Particle Network Unity config."
    />

    <img
      className="hidden dark:block"
      src="/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/images/unity-configure-2.png"
      alt="Particle Network Unity config."
    />

3.  Remove main.mm under MainApp folder.
4.  Under [/Assets/Plugins/iOS](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/tree/main/Assets/Plugins/iOS) are NativeCallProxy files and Swift files , they are required by Unity to interact with iOS code. Remove code under Particle Wallet GUI if you don't need wallet service.
5.  In `UnityManger.swift`, it has implemented methods defined in `NativeCallProxy.h`.
6.  Select `NativeCallProxy.h`, in the file inspector, check public in Target Membership.
7.  If you want to use `ParticleConnect`, you should add `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` to info.plist.

```xml Info.plist
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
<string>metamask</string>
<string>phantom</string>
<string>bitkeep</string>
<string>imtokenv2</string>
<string>rainbow</string>
<string>trust</string>
<string>zerion</string>
<string>mathwallet</string>
<string>oneinch</string>
<string>awallet</string>
<string>okex</string>
<string>bnc</string>
</array>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access in order to open photos of barcodes</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use the camera to scan barcodes</string>
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use Face ID for secure access to the app.</string>
```

#### Android configuration

Alternatively, if you're building your Unity game for Android, you'll just need to configure two files before you're ready to go. The first of these two files can be found at `Assets/Plugins/Android/launcherTemplate.gradle` within your project. Here, you'll need to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies.

Specifically, you'll need the following dependencies at a minimum:

- `network.particle:auth-service`if you're planning on using Particle Auth Directly
- `network.particle:unity-bridge`, required universally
- The full list of `network.particle` packages can be found [here](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=g:network.particle&smo=true).

```groovy launcherTemplate.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation project(':unityLibrary')
    implementation "network.particle:auth-service:${sdkVersion}"
    implementation "network.particle:unity-bridge:${sdkVersion}"
  	implementation "network.particle:connect:${sdkVersion}"
  	// Other dependencies
}
```

Finally, for Android, you'll need to place your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` within `gradleTemplate.properties`, found at `Assets/Plugins/Android/gradleTemplate.properties`.

```groovy gradleTemplate.properties
particle.network.project_client_key=Your Client Key
particle.network.project_id=Your Project ID
particle.network.app_id=Your App ID
```

---

### Initialization

Before you can call core functions within the SDK, you'll need to initialize `ParticleNetwork`. For the Unity SDK, this is handled by calling `init` on `ParticleNetwork`, which is derived from `Network.Particle.Scripts.Core` and passing in information about the primary chain being used. This is generally pulled from a child of `ChainInfo`.

<Tip>
  The Particle Auth Unity SDK does not require authentication from the [Particle
  dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).
</Tip>

```csharp
ParticleNetwork.Init(ChainInfo.Ethereum);
ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.Init();
```

#### Add the prefab to your scene

Additionally, you'll need to ensure `ParticleAuthCore.prefab` is added to your main scene. This is required as Particle Auth Core will not function otherwise.

---

## Examples of Utilization

### Connect

With Particle Auth Core configured and included within your first scene, you can leverage Particle Auth Core to initiate the social login onboarding process and thus unlock the remaining functions within the SDK (post-login).

This is achieved and configured via `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.Connect`. Once this method is called, a corresponding login popup will be displayed requesting user authentication before returning to the application in a signed-in state.

`ParticleAuthCore.Instance.Connect` takes the following parameters:

| Field                | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loginType`          | `LoginType`          | The specific social login to be used. This can be either `.EMAIL`, `.PHONE`, `.GOOGLE`, `.FACEBOOK`, `.APPLE`, `.TWITTER`, `.DISCORD`, `.GITHUB`, `.TWITCH`, `.MICROSOFT`, `.LINKEDIN` or `JWT`.                                                                                 |
| `account`            | `String?`            | (Optional) When `type` is set to either `.email`, `.phone`, or `.jwt`, you can use the `account` parameter to pass in an expected email, phone number, or JWT. This is optional for the former two, but required for `.jwt`. The phone number must be in E.164 format.           |
| `supportAuthTypeode` | `[SupportAuthType]`  | The methods of authentication visible on the authentication popup UI. By default, this will be exclusive to the chosen social login method, although by passing in additional types, you can expand the UI to include the ability to login with those as an alternative to type. |
| `socialLoginPrompt`  | `SocialLoginPrompt?` | (Optional) Changes what the OAuth provider prompts a user to do; either `.none`, `.consent`, or `.select_account`. Only Google, Discord and Microsoft support it.                                                                                                                                 |
| `loginPageConfig`    | `LoginPageConfig?`   | (Optional) to customize the UI page, contains project name, icon and description.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

```csharp
var loginConfig = new LoginPageConfig("Particle Unity Example", "Welcome to login",
                            "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png");
List<SupportLoginType> allSupportLoginTypes =
                    new List<SupportLoginType>(Enum.GetValues(typeof(SupportLoginType)) as SupportLoginType[]);
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.Connect(LoginType.EMAIL, null, SupportAuthType.ALL, SocialLoginPrompt.SelectAccount, loginConfig);
```

You can also customize login page for email/phone, send code with method `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SendPhoneCode` or `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SendEmailCode`, connect with method `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.ConnectWithCode`

<CodeGroup>

```csharp Email
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SendEmailCode(email);
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.ConnectWithCode(null, email, code);
```

```csharp Phone
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SendPhoneCode(phone);
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.ConnectWithCode(phone, null, code);
```

</CodeGroup>

### Disconnect

Once a user has been logged in, you can programmatically initiate logout through `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.Disconnect`.

```csharp
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.Disconnect();
```

### Is Connected

Whether or not a user is logged in may need to be retrieved, specifically in cases where a user stays logged in after refreshing an application due to the continuation of a given session. To check the currently active login status, you can call `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.IsConnected`.

```csharp
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.IsConnected();
```

### Get User Info

After connected, you can call `ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.GetUserInfo` to retrieve the userInfo.

```csharp
var userInfo = ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.GetUserInfo()
```

### Get Address

To retrieve the address of the currently active account (either EVM or Solana, depending on the previously selected chain), `ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.EvmGetAddress` or `ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.SolanaGetAddress` can be called.

```csharp
var evmAddress = ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.EvmGetAddress()
var solanaAddress = ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.SolanaGetAddress()
```

### Sign Message

Simple message signing can be achieved by calling `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.EvmPersonalSign` or `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SolanaPersonalSign` and passing in a standard string (no need for encoding on this method) with the message you'd like to be prompted for signature.

```csharp
var message = "Hello Particle!";

await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.EvmPersonalSign(message);
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.EvmPersonalSignUnique(message);

await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SolanaPersonalSign(message);
```

### Sign Transaction

Similarly, for signing a transaction, you'll need to call `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SolanaSignTransaction` and pass in a serialized (string) standard transaction object to be prompted for signature. This is a **Solana-specific** method.

```csharp
var transaction = "Your transaction";
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SolanaSignTransaction(transaction);
```

### Sign All Transactions

`ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SolanaSignAllTransactions` is another **Solana-specific** method that functions adjacent to the former but instead signs multiple (a list of) transactions represented as strings.

```csharp
var transaction1 = "Transaction1";
var transaction2 = "Transaction2";

string[] transactions = new[] { transaction1, transaction2 };

await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SolanaSignAllTransactions(transactions);
```

### Sign And Send Transaction

`ParticleAuthCore.Instance.EvmSendTransaction` and `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SolanaSignAndSendTransaction`are the primary methods within the SDK for sending transactions as it immediately sends a given transaction after requesting signature (confirmation). This will also take a serialized (string) representation of a transaction,

```csharp
var transaction = "Transaction";

var nativeResultData = await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.EvmSendTransaction(transaction);

var nativeResultData = await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SolanaSendTransaction(transaction);
```

### Sign Type Data

`ParticleAuthCore.Instance.EvmSignTypedData` is an **EVM-specific** method for signing structured (typed) data. For more information on `signTypedData`, see the [Web (JavaScript/TypeScript)](/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web) page.

```csharp
string typedData = "Your typedata";

await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.EvmSignTypedData(typedData);
```

### Set ChainInfo

If you'd like to set the primary chain after initial configuration, you'll need to use `ParticleNetwork.SetChainInfo`, which simply takes a `chainInfo` object parallel to the type of object passed into the original `ParticleNetwork.Init` call.

```csharp
ParticleNetwork.SetChainInfo(ChainInfo.Ethereum);

// Asynchronous, used for switch from evm to solana, or switch from solana to evm.
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SwitchChain(ChainInfo.Ethereum);
```

### Open Account and Security Page

Following the above, if you'd like to force the opening of account/security settings (in-UI), you can do so with `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.OpenAccountAndSecurity`.

```csharp
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.OpenAccountAndSecurity();
```

### Has Master Password, Payment Password, Security Account

Similarly to the `isConnected` function covered prior, there are various scenarios in which knowing whether or not a user has specific security settings enabled may be useful. In the case of the Particle Auth Flutter SDK, this can happen in one of two ways:

With the built-in `ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.HasMasterPassword`, `ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.HasPaymentPassword`, and `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.ChangeMasterPassword` methods.

```csharp
ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.HasMasterPassword();

ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.HasPaymentPassword();

await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.ChangeMasterPassword();
```

---

### Enable Blind Signing

Silently sign messages/transactions, this switch will work if the following conditions are met:

1. Your account is connected with JWT
2. Your account does not set payment password
3. SecurityAccountConfig.promptSettingWhenSign is 0, you can call `ParticleNetwork.SetSecurityAccountConfig` to update its value.

```csharp
// Enable blind signing
ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.SetBlindEnable(true);
// Retrieve whether or not blind signing is enabled
var enable = ParticleAuthCoreInteraction.GetBlindEnable();
```

---

## `EvmService` utilization examples

In addition to `ParticleAuthCore` for authentication and interaction with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service, the Unity mobile SDK also includes a class, `EvmService`, for general interaction with EVM chains.

### Write Contract

`EvmService.WriteContract` allows you to execute a write contract call defined by a specific method and set of parameters. This requires a corresponding ABI, contract address, and requester public address.

| Field             | Type           | Description                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from`            | `string`       | The user's public address                                                                                  |
| `contractAddress` | `string`       | The contract address                                                                                       |
| `methodName`      | `string`       | The method name that defined in the contract, add prefix `custom_`, like `custom_balanceOf`, `custom_mint` |
| `parameters`      | `List<object>` | The method's parameters                                                                                    |
| `abiJsonString`   | `string?`      | The method's abi json string                                                                               |
| `gasFeeLevel`     | `GasFeeLevel`  | (Optional) the gas fee level, `High`, `Medium` or `Low`, default is `High`                                 |

```csharp
// Contract ABI, JSON string
// For example,
// [{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"quantity\",\"type\":\"uint256\"},{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"amount\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"name\":\"mint\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"}]

var transaction = await EvmService.WriteContract(from, contractAddress, methodName, parameters,abiJsonString);
```

### Read Contract

`EvmService.ReadContract` allows you to execute a read-only contract call defined by a specific method and set of parameters. This requires a corresponding ABI, contract address, and requester public address.

| Field             | Type           | Description                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from`            | `string`       | The user's public address                                                                                  |
| `contractAddress` | `string`       | The contract address                                                                                       |
| `methodName`      | `string`       | The method name that defined in the contract, add prefix `custom_`, like `custom_balanceOf`, `custom_mint` |
| `parameters`      | `List<object>` | The method's parameters                                                                                    |
| `abiJsonString`   | `string?`      | The method's abi json string                                                                               |

```csharp
// Contract ABI, JSON string
// For example,
// [{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"quantity\",\"type\":\"uint256\"},{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"amount\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"name\":\"mint\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"}]

string rpcResult =
  await EvmService.ReadContract(from, contractAddress, methodName, parameters, abiJsonString);

var result = (string)JObject.Parse(rpcResult)["result"];

### Create Transaction

`EvmService.CreateTransaction` facilitates the construction of a transaction object derived from the standard `from`, `to` (`receiver` in this example), `amount` (`value`), and `data` fields. This transaction, once constructed with `EvmService.CreateTransaction`, can be passed for in-UI proposal with `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.EvmSendTransaction`.

| Field         | Type          | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from`        | `string`      | The user's public address.                                                  |
| `data`        | `string`      | The transaction's data.                                                     |
| `value`       | `BigInteger`  | The native amount.                                                          |
| `to`          | `String`      | The parameters of this method.                                              |
| `gasFeeLevel` | `GasFeeLevel` | (Optional) the gas fee level, `High`, `Medium` or `Low`, default is `High`. |

```csharp
var transaction = await EvmService.CreateTransaction(from, data, value, receiver);
```

### Estimate Gas

Given a standard transaction structure (detached set of values, as shown below), gas estimations can be ran to simulate and retrieve the volume of gas to be consumed by a specified transaction (wrapper for `eth_estimateGas`). This is done through `EvmService.EstimateGas`.

```csharp
final result = await EvmService.EstimateGas(from, to, value, data);
var gasLimit = (string)JObject.Parse(result)["result"];
```

### Get Suggested Gas Fees

To retrieve categorized gas price suggestions (3 categories scaling from low to high) based upon current network conditions, you can call `EvmService.SuggestedGasFees`.

```csharp
var gasFeesResult = await EvmService.SuggestedGasFees();
```

### Get Tokens and NFTs

`EvmService` also extends to Data API methods such as `GetTokensAndNFTs`, which returns a highly detailed JSON list of ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs belonging to a specified address. This is accessible through `EvmService.GetTokensAndNFTs`, passing in the public address to retrieve the tokens and NFTs of.

`tokenAddresses` is an optional parameter, for get the specific tokens.

```csharp
await EvmService.GetTokensAndNFTs(publicAddress, tokenAddresses);
await EvmService.GetTokens(publicAddress, tokenAddresses)
await EvmService.GetNFTs(publicAddress)
```

### Get Transactions by Address

Similar to the former method, `EvmService.GetTransactionsByAddress` enables the retrieval of a detailed JSON response containing a complete list of transactions involving a specified address.

```csharp
await EvmService.GetTransactionsByAddress(publicAddress);
```

### Get Price

To retrieve the price of specified tokens, you can call `EvmService.GetPrice`.

```csharp
 await EvmService.GetPrice(tokenAddresses, currencies);
```

### Basic RPC method

Basic RPC methods can be called manually through `EvmService.Rpc`, as shown below.

```csharp
await EvmService.Rpc(method, params);
```

## `SolanaService` utilization examples

In addition to `ParticleAuthCore` for authentication and interaction with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service, the Unity mobile SDK also includes a class, `SolanaService`, for general interaction with Solana chains.

### Get Tokens and NFTs

`SolanaService` also extends to Data API methods such as `GetTokensAndNFTs`, which returns a highly detailed JSON list of SPL tokens and NFTs belonging to a specified address. This is accessible through `SolanaService.GetTokensAndNFTs`, passing in the public address to retrieve the tokens and NFTs of.

```csharp
await SolanaService.GetTokensAndNFTs(publicAddress, true);
```

### Serialize Transactions

`SolanaService.SerializeSOLTransaction` facilitates the construction of a SOL transaction object.

These transactions, once constructed , can be passed for in-UI proposal with `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SolanaSendTransaction`.

```csharp
string receiver = "";
long amount = 10000000;
SerializeSOLTransReq req = new SerializeSOLTransReq(sender, receiver, amount);
var result = await SolanaService.SerializeSOLTransaction(req);

var resultData = JObject.Parse(result);
var transaction = (string)resultData["result"]["transaction"]["serialized"];
```

### Get Price

To retrieve the price of specified tokens, you can call `SolanaService.GetPrice`.

```csharp
 await SolanaService.GetPrice(tokenAddresses, currencies);
```

### Get transactions by Address

To retrieve transactions executed by a given address, you can call `SolanaService.getTransactionsByAddress`.

```csharp
await SolanaService.GetTransactionsByAddress(address);
```

### Get Token by Token Address

To obtain the balance of a specified token at a specified address, you can call `SolanaService.GetTokenByTokenAddresses`.

```csharp
await SolanaService.GetTokenByTokenAddresses(address, tokenAddresses);
```

### Basic RPC Method

Similar to `EvmService`, standard RPC methods can be called through `SolanaService.Rpc`.

```csharp
await SolanaService.Rpc(method, params);
```
