## Particle Auth for Flutter

The Particle Auth Flutter SDK enables full stack integration of Particle Auth into applications built on Flutter. This includes everything from the initial configuration of Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service to specific interactions. Specifically in this case, Flutter can be leveraged in either Android or iOS environments, both to the same degree. This is done primarily through Dart.

Platform-specific configuration instructions, alongside examples of utilization, can be found below.

## Getting Started

Interaction with the Particle Auth Flutter SDK is quite standard and in line with other Particle Auth SDKs, although the key deviations can be found within the configuration process. 

<Tip>The configuration process of this SDK differs significantly based on whether you're using Flutter on Android or iOS.</Tip>

To begin, you'll need to head over to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network) and retrieve your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`.

<Note>Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys: [Create a new project](/guides/quickstart/waas/mobile-quickstart#configuring-particle-auth).</Note>

### Adding the Particle Auth Flutter SDK to your application

Additionally, regardless of platform, you'll need to begin by adding `particle_auth_core` to your Flutter application; this is a requirement before moving onto platform-specific configuration.

```shell Terminal
flutter pub add particle_auth_core 
```

### Android configuration

If you're building an Android application with Flutter, you must follow the steps below to configure Particle Auth. To begin, you'll need to go ahead and open your `build.gradle` file, often found at the following file path: `${project name}/android/app/build.gradle`

Within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to add four new lines to ensure Particle Auth runs appropriately:

1. `minSdkVersion`, which in most cases will be set to `23`.
2. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"]`, the `projectId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
3. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"]`, the `clientKey` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.
4. `manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"]`, the `appId` previously retrieved from the Particle dashboard.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
defaultConfig {
  applicationId "com.example.particle_auth_test"

  minSdkVersion 23 // Required by Particle Auth
  targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion
  versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
  versionName flutterVersionName

  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_ID"] = "EXAMPLE"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY"] = "EXAMPLE"
  manifestPlaceholders["PN_APP_ID"] = "EXAMPLE"
}
```

Staying within your `build.gradle` file, you'll need to ensure that you're using version 11 of Java in both `compileOptions` and `kotlinOptions`, alongside enabling `dataBinding`.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
compileOptions {
  sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11
  targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}

kotlinOptions {
  jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_11 
}

dataBinding {
  enabled = true
}
```

Finally, for dependency management, within `build.gradle` you'll need to ensure that the `repositories` object in both `buildscript` and `allprojects` has `maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }` present, such as is shown below.

```groovy build.gradle
// Example
buildscript {
  ...
  repositories {
      google()
      mavenCentral()
      maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }  // Add this
  }

  dependencies {
      ...
  }
}


allprojects {
  repositories {
      google()
      mavenCentral()
      maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }  // Add this
  }
}

...

```

***

### iOS configuration

If you're building an iOS application with Flutter, this also entails a unique and iOS-specific configuration process. Before beginning, ensure your project meets the following prerequisites:

- Xcode 15.0 or later.

- iOS 14 or later.

With these requirements set, you'll need to open an exported iOS project and find `apps/{project name}.xcworkspace`. 

At the root of your Xcode project, create a new file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Ensure this is marked under `Target Membership`.

Now, with a fresh `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file, go ahead and fill it in with the following:

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Similar to the Android configuration, you'll need to fill in `PROJECT_UUID` (`projectId`), `PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY`, and `PROJECT_APP_UUID` (`appId`) with the corresponding values retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).


Finally, you'll need to edit your Podfile to ensure `particle_auth_core` is properly imported. Head over to the [linked guide](https://pub.dev/packages/particle_auth_core/install) to complete this, if you haven't already.

<Note>
<p>Another important note before continuing.</p>
<p>Our SDK is a static library (XCFramework). When using the Particle Auth Flutter SDK, you'll need to specify that you're using a static framework through the following:</p>
<p>

```ruby
 target 'Runner' do
   use_frameworks! :linkage => :static
   pod 'Thresh'
   pod 'ParticleMPCCore'
   pod 'ParticleAuthCore'
   pod 'AuthCoreAdapter'
 
   pod 'ParticleNetworkBase'
   pod 'ConnectCommon'
  end

  post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
end
```

</p>
</Note>

<Tip> Add Privacy - Face ID Usage Description to your info.plist file </Tip>

***

## Examples of utilization

### Initialization

Before using the full extent of the SDK, you'll need to initialize it with `init`, passing in specific chain in which you intend to primary onboard to within Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service. This is represented as an object containing chain info (often derived from `ChainInfo.{Chain}`).

```dart
// set the project info, get it from dashboard.
ParticleInfo.set(projectId, clientKey);
// inititilze ParticleAuth and ParticleAuthCore.
ParticleBase.init(ChainInfo.Ethereum, env);
ParticleAuthCore.init()
```

### Connect

Now that you've installed, configured, and initialized Particle Auth, you'll need to initiate a login and throw a social login prompt for a user to authenticate through. Post-login (through the menu obtained via the login), a user will have an account generated, thus unlocking the remaining SDK methods for interaction.

This is achieved and configured through `ParticleAuthCore.connect`. Once this method is called, the corresponding login popup will be thrown by requesting user authentication before returning to the application in a signed-in state.

`ParticleAuthCore.connect` takes the following parameters:

| Field              | Type                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loginType`        | `LoginType`              | The specific social login to be used. This can be either `.email`, `.phone`, `.google`, `.apple`, `.jwt`, `.facebook`, `.twitter`, `.discord`, `.github`, `.twitch`, `.microsoft` or `linkedin`.                                                                                 |
| `account`          | `String?`                | (Optional) when `type` is set to either `.email`, `.phone`, or `.jwt`, you can use the `account` parameter to pass in an expected email, phone number, or JWT. This is optional for the former two, but required for `.jwt`. The phone number must be in E.164 format.           |
| `prompt`           | `SocialLoginPrompt?`     | (Optional) either `.none`, `.consent`, or `.select_account`                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `loginPageConfig`  | `LoginPageConfig?`       | (Optional) to customize the UI page, contains project name, icon and description.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `supportAuthTypes` | `List<SupportAuthType>?` | The methods of authentication visible on the authentication popup UI. By default, this will be exclusive to the chosen social login method, although by passing in additional types, you can expand the UI to include the ability to login with those as an alternative to type. |

```dart
ParticleAuthCore.connect(LoginType.google, prompt: SocialLoginPrompt.select_account);

ParticleAuthCore.connect(LoginType.email, supportAuthTypes: SupportAuthType.values, prompt: SocialLoginPrompt.select_account);
```

### Is Connected

There may be scenarios in which knowing whether a current session (a user) is currently logged in with Particle Auth or not is important. This is achieved through `ParticleAuthCore.isConnected` (server-side check).

```dart
await ParticleAuthCore.isConnected();
```

### Disconnect

To exit an existing session (logging a user out), you can simply call `ParticleAuthCore.disconnect`.

```dart
await ParticleAuthCore.disconnect();
```

### Get User Info

To retrieve the userInfo, you can call `ParticleAuthCore.getUserInfo`.

```dart
final userInfo = await ParticleAuthCore.getUserInfo();
```

### Get Address

To retrieve the address, you can call `Evm.getAddress` or `Solana.getAddress`. 

```dart
final address = await Evm.getAddress();
final address = await Solana.getAddress();
```

### Sign Message (EIP191)

To request an EIP191 signature from a user's embedded wallet, you can use either the `Evm.personalSign` or `Evm.personalSignUnique` method. If you need the same message to return a unique signature each time, use the `Evm.personalSignUnique` method. Otherwise, the `Evm.personalSign` method is generally recommended. On Solana, you can call `Solana.signMessage`, you can pass in a UTF-8/readable string.


| Field     | Type     | Description                                                                       |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message` | `String` | On Evm requires a hexadeciaml string, on Solana, requires a UTF-8/readable string |

```dart
final messageHex = "0x${StringUtils.toHexString("Hello Particle")}";
String signature = await Evm.personalSign(messageHex);
String signature = await Evm.personalSignUnique(messageHex);

const message = "Hello Particle";
final signature = await Solana.signMessage(message);
```

### Sign Transaction

This is a **Solana-specific** method for signing a transaction without sending it. Similar to message signing, this will prompt a signature in-UI with details about the transaction. Programmatically, the proposed transaction should be formatted as a (converted to a) base58 string. Passing in an object directly will not work in this case. 

| Field         | Type     | Description              |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| `transaction` | `String` | Requires a base58 string |

```dart
final signature = await Solana.signTransaction(transaction);
```

### Sign All Transactions

Following the aforementioned method, you can use `Solana.signAllTransactions` to propose a collection of **Solana** transactions for signature, rather than just a single transaction.

| Field          | Type           | Description                           |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `transactions` | `List<String>` | Each element requires a base58 string |


```dart
List<String> signatures = await Solana.signAllTransactions(transactions);
```

### Sign and Send Transaction

For more generalized transaction sending, `Evm.sendTransaction`and `Solana.signAndSendTransaction` will be the primary method used in virtually every scenario. This will propose a signature (on both EVM and Solana), and then immediately push it to the network once confirmed.

| Field         | Type     | Description                                                               |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transaction` | `String` | On Evm requires a hexadeciaml string, on Solana, requires a base58 string |


```dart
final signature = await Evm.sendTransaction(transaction);
final signature = await Solana.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);
```

### Sign Typed Data V4 (EIP712)

To request an EIP712 signature from a user's embedded wallet, you can use either the `Evm.signTypedData` or `Evm.signTypedDataUnique` method. If you need the same message to return a unique signature each time, use the `Evm.signTypedDataUnique` method. Otherwise, the `Evm.signTypedData` method is generally recommended.

| Field     | Type     | Description                   |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `message` | `String` | Requires a hexadeciaml string |


```dart
// your typed data is a json string
String typedDataHex = "0x${StringUtils.toHexString(typedData)}";

String signature = await Evm.signTypedData(typedDataHex);
String signature = await Evm.signTypedDataUnique(typedDataHex);
```

### Set Chain Info

If you'd like to set the chain being utilized (after initially defining this in `init`), you can call either `ParticleBase.setChainInfo` (synchronous) or ` ParticleAuthCore.switchChain` (asynchronous), often derived from `ChainInfo.{Chain}`.

```dart
await ParticleBase.setChainInfo(ChainInfo.Ethereum);

await ParticleAuthCore.switchChain(ChainInfo.Ethereum);
```

### Get Chain Info

For the retrieval of the currently selected (primary) chain within an active session, you'll need to call `ParticleBase.getChainInfo`. This returns a ChainInfo object containing:

- `name`, the name of the chain in question (ex: Ethereum).
- `id`, the ID of the chain in question (ex: 11155111).
- `network`, the specific network corresponding to the chain ID (ex: Sepolia)

```dart
final chainInfo = await ParticleBase.getChainInfo();
int id = chainInfo.id;
String name = chainInfo.name;
String network = chainInfo.network;
```

### Set Security Account Config

Another important component of integrating the Particle Auth SDK (Wallet-as-a-Service) is the (optional) security account requirements enforced upon application users. For all accounts on Particle, several security options are associated (such as a master password for a login-based non-recoverable password, payment password for a pin required upon transaction signatures, etc.)

Within the SDK, you can configure the frequency (or requirement) a user is asked to configure security settings. This is controlled with `ParticleBase.setSecurityAccountConfig` and passing in a `SecurityAccountConfig` object with two parameters:

| Field                                  | Type  | Description                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `promptSettingWhenSign`                | `int` | The security account config prompts (default is 1). |
| `promptMasterPasswordSettingWhenLogin` | `int` | The master password prompts (default is 0).         |

- `0` means a prompt is never shown requesting this setting.
- `1` means a prompt is shown only upon the first startup.
- `2` means a prompt is shown every time.
- `3` means force set payment password before sign.

```dart
final config = SecurityAccountConfig(1, 2);
ParticleBase.setSecurityAccountConfig(config);
```

### Open Account and Security Page

Following the above, if you'd like to force the opening of account/security settings (in-UI), you can do so with `ParticleAuthCore.openAccountAndSecurity`.

```dart
await ParticleAuthCore.openAccountAndSecurity();
```

### Has Master Password, Payment Password, Security Account

Similarly to the `isConnected` function covered prior, there are various scenarios in which knowing whether or not a user has specific security settings enabled may be useful. In the case of the Particle Auth Flutter SDK, this can happen in one of two ways:

With the built-in `ParticleAuthCore.hasMasterPassword`, `ParticleAuthCore.hasPaymentPassword`, and `ParticleAuthCore.changeMasterPassword` methods.

```dart
await ParticleAuthCore.hasMasterPassword();
await ParticleAuthCore.hasPaymentPassword();
await ParticleAuthCore.changeMasterPassword();
```

### Set Appearance

You can forcibly set a specific appearance to be used within the UI using `ParticleBase.setAppearance`. By default, it will follow current system setting.

| Field        | Type         | Description                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `appearance` | `Appearance` | The specific appearance to be used. This can be either `.system`, `.dark`, `.light`. |

```dart
// this is the default setting  
ParticleBase.setAppearance(Appearance.system);
// dark  
ParticleBase.setAppearance(Appearance.dark);
// light  
ParticleBase.setAppearance(Appearance.light);
```

### Set and Get Language

You can forcibly set a specific language to be used within the UI using `ParticleBase.setLanguage`, with retrieval of the current active language facilitated by `ParticleBase.getLanguage`. By default, this is set to English.

| Field      | Type       | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language` | `Language` | The specific language to be used. This can be either `.en`, `.ja`, `.zh_hans`, `.zh_hant`, `.ko`. |

```dart
ParticleBase.setLanguage(Language.en)

ParticleBase.getLanguage()
```

---

## `EvmService` utilization examples

In addition to `ParticleAuthCore` for authentication and interaction with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service, the Flutter SDK also includes a class, `EvmService`, for general interaction with EVM chains.

### Write Contract

`EvmService.writeContract` allows you to execute a write contract call defined by a specific method and set of parameters. This requires a corresponding ABI, contract address, and requester public address.

| Field             | Type           | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`         | `String`       | The user's public address.                                                  |
| `contractAddress` | `String`       | The contract address.                                                       |
| `methodName`      | `String`       | The method name that defined in the contract, such as `mint`, `balanceOf`.  |
| `parameters`      | `List<Object>` | The parameters of this method.                                              |
| `abiJsonString`   | `String`       | The abi json string of this method.                                         |
| `gasFeeLevel`     | `GasFeeLevel`  | (Optional) the gas fee level, `high`, `medium` or `low`, default is `high`. |


```dart
String contractAddress = "your contract address";
String methodName = "your method name"; // this is your contract method name, like balanceOf, mint.
List<Object> params = <Object>["0x1"]; // this is the method params, each parameter requires a hexadecimal string.

// abi json string, you can get it from your contract developer.
// such as
// [{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"quantity\",\"type\":\"uint256\"},{\"internalType\":\"uint256\",\"name\":\"amount\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"name\":\"mint\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"}]
const abiJsonString = null;
final result = EvmService.writeContract(publicAddress, contractAddress, methodName, params, abiJsonString, gasFeeLevel: GasFeeLevel.high);
```

### Read Contract

`EvmService.readContract` allows you to execute a read-only contract call defined by a specific method and set of parameters. This requires a corresponding ABI, contract address, and requester public address.

| Field             | Type           | Description                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`         | `String`       | The user's public address.                                                 |
| `contractAddress` | `String`       | The contract address.                                                      |
| `methodName`      | `String`       | The method name that defined in the contract, such as `mint`, `balanceOf`. |
| `parameters`      | `List<Object>` | The parameters of this method.                                             |
| `abiJsonString`   | `String`       | The abi json string of this method.                                        |

```dart
String publicAddress = "your public address";
String contractAddress = "your contract address"; 
String methodName ="your method name"; // ex: balanceOf, mint
List<Object> parameters = <Object>["0x1"];  // this is the method params, each parameter requires a hexadecimal string.

// ex: [{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"quantity","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"mint","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]  
const abiJsonString = null;

final result = await EvmService.readContract(publicAddress, contractAddress, methodName, parameters, abiJsonString);
```

### Create Transaction

`EvmService.createTransaction` facilitates the construction of a transaction object derived from the standard `from`, `to` (`receiver` in this example), `amount` (`value`), and `data` fields. This transaction, once constructed with `EvmService.createTransaction`, can be passed for in-UI proposal with `ParticleAuthCore.sendTransaction`.

| Field         | Type          | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from`        | `String`      | The user's public address.                                                  |
| `data`        | `String`      | The transaction's data.                                                     |
| `value`       | `BigInt`      | The native amount.                                                          |
| `to`          | `String`      | If you send a erc20, erc721, erc1155 or interact with a contract, this is the contract address, if you send native, this is receiver address.                                              |
| `gasFeeLevel` | `GasFeeLevel` | (Optional) the gas fee level, `high`, `medium` or `low`, default is `high`. |

```dart
String from = "your public address";
String receiver = "receiver address"  
String contractAddress = "contract address"
BigInt amount = BigInt.from(1000000000000000);
String to = contractAddress;
final data =  await EvmService.erc20Transfer(contractAddress, receiver, amount);

final transaction = await EvmService.createTransaction(from, data, amount, to, gasFeeLevel: GasFeeLevel.high);
```

### Estimate Gas

Given a standard transaction structure (detached set of values, as shown below), gas estimations can be ran to simulate and retrieve the volume of gas to be consumed by a specified transaction (wrapper for `eth_estimateGas`). This is done through `EvmService.ethEstimateGas`.

```dart
final gasLimit = await EvmService.ethEstimateGas(from, to, value, data);
```

### Get Suggested Gas Fees

To retrieve categorized gas price suggestions (3 categories scaling from low to high) based upon current network conditions, you can call `EvmService.suggestedGasFees`.

```dart
final gasFees = await EvmService.suggestedGasFees();
```

### Get Tokens and NFTs

`EvmService` also extends to Data API methods such as `getTokensAndNFTs`, which returns a highly detailed JSON list of ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs belonging to a specified address. This is accessible through `EvmService.getTokensAndNFTs`, passing in the public address to retrieve the tokens and NFTs of, also you can retrieve tokens from `getTokens` or NFTs from `getNFTs`

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `address` | `String` | The user's public address.|
| `tokenAddresses` | `List<String>` | The specific tokens' addresses |

```dart
final result = await EvmService.getTokensAndNFTs(publicAddress, []);
final result = await EvmService.getTokens(publicAddress, []);
final result = await EvmService.getNFTs(publicAddress, []);
```

### Get Transactions by Address

Similar to the former method, `EvmService.getTransactionsByAddress` enables the retrieval of a detailed JSON response containing a complete list of transactions involving a specified address.

```dart
final result = await EvmService.getTransactionsByAddress(publicAddress);
```

### Get Price

To retrieve token price based upon current network conditions, you can call `EvmService.getPrice`.

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenAddresses` | `List<String>` | The tokens's addresses, for native token, you can pass `"native"` |
| `currencies` | `List<String>` | The price unity, such as `"usd"` |

```dart
final result = await EvmService.getPrice(tokenAddresses, currencies);
```

### Basic Rpc Method

Call any basic EVM rpc method through `EvmService.rpc`

```dart
final result = await EvmService.rpc(method, params);
```

## `SolanaService` utilization examples

In addition to `ParticleAuth` for authentication and interaction with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service, the Flutter SDK also includes a class, `SolanaService`, for general interaction with Solana chains.

### Get Tokens and NFTs

`SolanaService` also extends to Data API methods such as `getTokensAndNFTs`, which returns a highly detailed JSON list of SPL tokens and NFTs belonging to a specified address. This is accessible through `SolanaService.getTokensAndNFTs`, passing in the public address to retrieve the tokens and NFTs of.


| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `address` | `String` | The user's public address.|
| `parseMetadataUri` | `bool` | if parse the nft meta data. |

```dart
final result = await SolanaService.getTokensAndNFTs(publicAddress, true);
```

### Serialize Transactions

`SolanaService.serializeSolTransaction`  facilitates the construction of a SOL transaction object,

`SolanaService.serializeSplTokenTransaction`  facilitates the construction of a Spl-token transaction object,

`SolanaService.serializeWSolTokenTransaction` facilitates the construction of a unwrap wsol transaction object. 

These transactions, once constructed, can be passed for in-UI proposal with `Solana.signAndSendTransaction`.

<CodeGroup>

```dart Send sol
final transaction = SerializeSOLTransaction();  
transaction.lamports = TestAccount.solana.amount.toInt();  
transaction.receiver = TestAccount.solana.publicAddress;  
transaction.sender = publicAddress;

final result = await SolanaService.serializeSolTransaction(transaction);
final serializedTransaction = result["transaction"]["serialized"];
```

```dart Send spl token
final transaction = SerializeSplTokenTransaction();
transaction.amount = TestAccount.solana.amount.toInt();
transaction.receiver = TestAccount.solana.publicAddress;
transaction.mint = TestAccount.solana.tokenContractAddress;
transaction.sender = publicAddress;

final result = await SolanaService.serializeSplTokenTransaction(transaction);
final serializedTransaction = result["transaction"]["serialized"];
```

```dart Unwrap WSOL
final transaction = SerializeWSOLTransaction();
transaction.address = publicAddress;

final result = await SolanaService.serializeWSolTokenTransaction(transaction);
final serializedTransaction = result["transaction"]["serialized"];
```

</CodeGroup>

### Get Price

To retrieve token price based upon current network conditions, you can call `SolanaService.getPrice`.

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenAddresses` | `List<String>` | The tokens's addresses, for native token, you can pass `"native"` |
| `currencies` | `List<String>` | The price unity, such as `"usd"` |


```dart
final result = await SolanaService.getPrice(tokenAddresses, currencies);
```

### Get Transactions by address

To retrieve transactions from a address, you can call `SolanaService.getTransactionsByAddress`.

```dart
final result = await SolanaService.getTransactionsByAddress(address);
```

### Get Token by Token Address

To obtain the balance of a specified token at a specified address, you can call `SolanaService.getTokenByTokenAddresses`

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `address` | `String` | The user's public address.|
| `tokenAddresses` | `List<String>` | The tokens' addresses |

```dart
await SolanaService.getTokenByTokenAddresses(address, tokenAddresses);
```

### Basic Rpc Method

Call any basic Solana rpc method through `SolanaService.rpc`

```dart
await SolanaService.rpc(method, params);
```
