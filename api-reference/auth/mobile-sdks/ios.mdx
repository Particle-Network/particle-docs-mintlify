## Particle Auth for iOS

The Particle Auth iOS SDK is the primary means of integrating Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service within applications on iOS. From initialization and configuration to onboarding and account utilization, this SDK acts as the master library for interacting with Particle on iOS.

The Particle Auth iOS SDK follows configuration and implementation mechanisms similar to the Particle Auth Android SDK. The specifics of integration, along with several examples, will be covered below.

## Getting Started

Implementation of the Particle Auth iOS SDK only takes a few lines of code, although before getting to that point, you'll need to meet a few key prerequisites in mind to ensure compatibility.

### Prerequisites

- Xcode **15.0** or later.
- CocoaPods **1.14.3** or higher.
- Your project must target these platform versions or later:
  - iOS **14**.

### Configuration

To begin the initialization process, you must head over to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network) and create a project alongside a corresponding application.

These will control specific customizations, statistics, and more for your instance of Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service. After creating an application, you'll need to retrieve three key values: `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`. We'll be using these down the road.

<Note>
  Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys:
  [Create a new
  project](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/auth/ios-quickstart).
</Note>

### Installation

Now that you've created a project and an application within the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network), you'll need to go ahead and install the Particle Auth SDK using CocoaPads (assuming you meet the previously mentioned minimum version requirements).

1. If you don't already have a Podfile, create one from the root of your project directory with:

   ```shell Terminal
   pod init
   ```

2. Within the newly created Podfile, add the `ParticleAuthCore`, `ParticleMPCCore`, and `Thresh` pod.

   ```ruby Podfile
   pod 'ParticleAuthCore'
   pod 'ParticleMPCCore'
   pod 'Thresh'
   ```

3. Install the pods, then open your .xcworkspace file to see the project in Xcode.

   ```shell Terminal
   pod install --repo-update
   open your-project.xcworkspace
   ```

<Tip>
  For release updates, subscribe to the [GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-ios).
</Tip>

#### Podfile Configuration

Additionally, you'll need to ensure that your resulting Podfile is properly configured and contains a snippet similar to the example below.

```ruby Podfile
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
end
```

#### Initialization

Now that you've configured your [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network), installed the SDK, and configured a Podfile, it's time to initialize the SDK with the aforementioned `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` retrieved from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

1. Create a `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file from the root of your corresponding Xcode project.

2. Paste the following text into this file:

   ```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
   	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
   	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
   	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
   	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
   	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
   	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
   </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

3. Replace the placeholders with the values retrieved from your project and application within the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

4. Import the `ParticleNetworkBase` module in your `AppDelegate.swift` file.

   ```swift AppDelegate.swift
   import ParticleNetworkBase
   ```

5. Initialize the ParticleNetwork service, which is typically located within your app's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

   ```swift AppDelegate.swift
   // Set a primary network, derived from ChainInfo
   // For release, this can be set to DevEnvironment.production
   ParticleNetwork.initialize(config: .init(chainInfo: .ethereum, devEnv: .debug))
   ```

6. Add Privacy - Face ID Usage Description to your info.plist file, head over to your `Info.plist` file and include the following snippet:

   ```xml Info.plist
   <key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
     <string>We use Face ID for secure access to the app.</string>
   ```

### Switch Chain

To switch the used chain after initial configuration, `auth.switchChain` is used. This enables asynchronous switching. Similar to the initial configuration, chain information derived from `ParticleNetwork.ChainInfo` can be passed as the primary parameter, determining the destination chain.

| Field       | Type        | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chainInfo` | `ChainInfo` | A chainInfo object, can be derived from `ParticleNetwork.ChainInfo`. |

```swift
let auth = Auth()
let result = try await auth.switchChain(chainInfo: .ethereum)

// For switching chains synchronously, without checking login status
ParticleNetwork.setChainInfo(.ethereum)
```

## Examples of utilization

### Connect

`auth.connect` is the main mechanism for facilitating login (account creation or sign in) with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service. Specifically, five key parameters are available within `auth.connect`:

| Field               | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`              | `LoginType`          | The specific social login to be used. This can be either `.email`, `.phone`, `.google`, `.apple`, `.jwt`, `.facebook`, `.twitter`, `.discord`, `.github`, `.twitch`, `.microsoft` or `linkedin`.                                                                       |
| `account`           | `String?`            | (Optional) When `type` is set to either `.email`, `.phone`, or `.jwt`, you can use the `account` parameter to pass in an expected email, phone number, or JWT. This is optional for the former two, but required for `.jwt`. When passing a phone number, it must be in E.164 format. |
| `code`              | `String?`            | (Optional) When `type` is set to either `.email` pr `.phone`, you can use the `code` parameter to pass the verification code.                                                                                                                                            |
| `socialLoginPrompt` | `SocialLoginPrompt?` | (Optional) Changes what the OAuth provider prompts a user to do; either `.none`, `.consent`, or `.select_account`. Only Google, Discord and Microsoft support it.                                                                                                                                                                  |

<Tip>You can use your existing user base or authentication method with Particle Auth through JWT. This way, your users can still log in with their current accounts. Click [here](/guides/configuration/auth/jwt) to learn how to configure jwt. </Tip>

```swift
// Connect with Google
let userInfo = try await auth.connect(type: .google, socialLoginPrompt: .selectAccount)

// Send verification code to email or phone number, the phone number must be in E.164 format.
var result = try await auth.sendEmailCode(email: "user@example.com")
var result = try await auth.sendPhoneCode(email: "+11234567890")

// Connect with email or phone, the phone number must be in E.164 format.
let userInfo = try await auth.connect(type: .email, account: "user@example.com", code: "xxxxxx")
let userInfo = try await auth.connect(type: .phone, account: "+11234567890", code: "xxxxxx")

// Connect with JWT
let jwt = "json web token"
let userInfo = try await auth.connect(type: .jwt, account: jwt)
```

`auth.presentLoginPage` is another mechanism for facilitating login (account creation or sign in) with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service. Upon calling this method, an authentication UI will be thrown, and the user will be asked to sign in with a specified login method. Specifically, five key parameters are available within `auth.presentLoginPage`:

| Field                | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`               | `LoginType`          | The specific social login to be used. This can be either `.email`, `.phone`, `.google`, `.apple`, `.jwt`, `.facebook`, `.twitter`, `.discord`, `.github`, `.twitch`, `.microsoft` or `linkedin`.                                                                                 |
| `account`            | `String?`            | (Optional) When `type` is set to either `.email`, `.phone`, or `.jwt`, you can use the `account` parameter to pass in an expected email, phone number, or JWT. This is optional for the former two, but required for `.jwt`. When passing a phone number, it must be in E.164 format.           |
| `supportAuthTypeode` | `[SupportAuthType]`  | The methods of authentication visible on the authentication popup UI. By default, this will be exclusive to the chosen social login method, although by passing in additional types, you can expand the UI to include the ability to login with those as an alternative to type. |
| `socialLoginPrompt`  | `SocialLoginPrompt?` | (Optional) Changes what the OAuth provider prompts a user to do; either `.none`, `.consent`, or `.select_account`. Only Google, Discord and Microsoft support it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `config`             | `LoginPageConfig?`   | (Optional) To customize the UI page, contains project name, icon and description.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

```swift
var userInfo = try await auth.presentLoginPage(type: type, account: text, socialLoginPrompt: .selectAccount, config: config)
```

After connect is successful, detailed user information can be retrieved by calling `auth.getUserInfo`.

### Is Connected

To check the user's login status, `auth.getUserInfo() != nil` returns a Boolean based upon the current state of a session (whether or not a user is currently logged into an account). Additionally, an asynchronous method, `auth.isConnected` can be called and subscribed to, returning `userInfo` upon a status of `true`.

```swift
// Local
let result = auth.getUserInfo() != nil
// Server side
let result = try await auth.isConnected()
```

### Disconnect

`auth.disconnect` will simply log a user out of their existing session, assuming they're logged in.

```swift
let result = try await auth.disconnect()
```

### UserInfo and Address Retrieval (post-login)

Once a user has logged in, you'll have access to various methods such as `auth.getUserInfo` and `auth.evm.getAddress`to retrieve specific user details. The `getUserInfo` response will, by default, include both an associated EVM and Solana address, while `auth.evm.getAddress` will return an EVM address, `auth.solana.getAddress` will return a Solana address.

```swift
auth.getUserInfo()
auth.evm.getAddress()
auth.solana.getAddress()
```

---

### Signatures

Once `ParticleNetwork` has been initialized and a user has successfully logged in, signatures can be proposed for confirmation through a popup

### EVM

### Sign Message (EIP191)

To request an EIP191 signature from a user's embedded wallet, you can use either the `auth.evm.personalSign` or `auth.evm.personalSignUnique` method. If you need the same message to return a unique signature each time, use the `auth.evm.personalSignUnique` method. Otherwise, the `auth.evm.personalSign` method is generally recommended.

| Field       | Type         | Description                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`   | `String`     | Either a hexadecimal string starting with '0x' or a human-readable string is required. |
| `chainInfo` | `ChainInfo?` | (Optional) Default is current chainInfo, the specific chain selected          |

```swift
let result = try await auth.evm.personalSign("This is the message that is being signed", chainInfo: nil)
let result = try await auth.evm.personalSignUnique("This is the message that is being signed", chainInfo: nil)
```

### Sign Typed Data V4 (EIP712)

To request an EIP712 signature from a user's embedded wallet, you can use either the `auth.evm.signTypedData` or `auth.evm.signTypedDataUnique` method. If you need the same message to return a unique signature each time, use the `auth.evm.signTypedDataUnique` method. Otherwise, the `auth.evm.signTypedData` method is generally recommended.

| Field       | Type         | Description                                                                   |

| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transaction` | `String`     | A hexadecimal string starting with "0x" is required.                                   |
| `chainInfo`   | `ChainInfo?` | (Optional) default is current chainInfo, the specific use which chain to sign and send |

```swift
let result = try await auth.evm.sendTransaction(transaction, chainInfo: nil)
```

---

### Solana

### Signing Messages

To request a signature from a user's embedded wallet, you can use `auth.solana.signMessage`.

| Field       | Type         | Description                                                                   |

```swift
let message = Base58.encode("This is the message that is being signed".data(using: .utf8)!)
let result = try await auth.solana.signMessage(message, chainInfo: nil)
```

---

### Transaction

To send a transaction from a user's embedded wallet, you can use `auth.solana.signAndSendTransaction`.

| Field         | Type         | Description                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transaction` | `String`     | A base58 formatted string is required.                                                 |
| `chainInfo`   | `ChainInfo?` | (Optional) default is current chainInfo, the specific use which chain to sign and send |

```swift
let result = try await auth.solana.signAndSendTransaction(transaction, chainInfo: nil)
```

To sign a transaction from a user's embedded wallet, you can use `auth.solana.signTransaction`.

| Field         | Type         | Description                                                                   |

```swift
let result = try await auth.solana.signAllTransactions(transactions, chainInfo: nil)
```

You can create en EVM transaction with class `TxData` or `FeeMarketEIP1559TxData`, also you can use another SDK `ParticleWalletAPI` to create transaction, you can reference the examples from [Wallet SDK reference](/api-reference/wallet/mobile/ios), all the rpc methods are defined in `ParticleWalletAPI`.

---

### Open Account and Security

If you'd like to force the "Account and Security" options to be opened on-screen (from which you can control payment passwords, additional accounts, and so on), then you can call `auth.openAccountAndSecurity`. Upon calling this method, a popup allowing the user to control security settings will appear.

```swift
try auth.openAccountAndSecurity()
```

---

### Set Security Account Config

Within the security settings, specific popups can be set to display upon confirmation or wallet UI entrance. These popups include `promptSettingWhenSign`, which refers to payment (signature) passwords, and `promptMasterPasswordSettingWhenLogin`, which refers to a login-based master password.

By default, `promptSettingWhenSign` is set to 1, which will show the prompt upon the first signature a given account conducts. If it's set to 0, it will never be shown; if it's set to 2, it will be shown upon every signature confirmation, if it's set to 3, it will be forced to set payment password.

This same logic applies to `promptMasterPasswordSettingWhenLogin`, which by default is set to 0.

```swift
ParticleNetwork.setSecurityAccountConfig(config:
  .init(promptSettingWhenSign: 1, promptMasterPasswordSettingWhenLogin: 2))

let securityAccountConfig = PartilceNetwork.getSecurityAccountConfig()
```

---

### Master Password and Payment Password

User can set master password and payment password to protect assets, call `auth.changeMasterPassword` to set or change master password, call `auth.openAccountAndSecurity()` to set or change payment password.

```swift
// Check if user has a master password set
let result = try auth.hasMasterPassword()
// Set or change master password
let result = try await auth.changeMasterPassword()

// Check if user has a payment password set
let result = try auth.hasPaymentPassword()
// Open a general account security page
let result = try auth.openAccountAndSecurity()
```

---

### Set Appearance

You can forcibly set a specific appearance to be used within the UI using `ParticleNetwork.setAppearance`. By default, it will follow current system setting.

| Field        | Type                   | Description                                                                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appearance` | `UIUserInterfaceStyle` | The specific appearance to be used. This can be either `.unspefified`, `.dark`, `.light`. |

```swift
// This is the default setting, auto
ParticleNetwork.setAppearance(.unspecified)
// Dark mode
ParticleNetwork.setAppearance(.dark)
// Light mode
ParticleNetwork.setAppearance(.light)
```

---

### Set and Get Language

You can forcibly set a specific language to be used within the UI using `ParticleNetwork.setLanguage`, with retrieval of the current active language facilitated by `ParticleNetwork.getLanguage`. By default, this is set to English.

| Field      | Type       | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language` | `Language` | The specific language to be used. This can be either `.en`, `.ja`, `.zh_hans`, `.zh_hant`, `.ko`. |

```swift
ParticleNetwork.setLanguage(Language.en)

ParticleNetwork.getLanguage()
```

### Set Custom UI JSON string

```swift
// Configure a custom UI through passing a JSON string
let jsonString = "Your custom UI json string, keys should be the same with customUIConfig.json in demo"
Auth.loadCustomUIJsonString(jsonString)
```

### Set FiatCoin

You can set a specific fiat currency to be used within the UI using `ParticleNetwork.setFiatCoin`, with retrieval of the current active language facilitated by `ParticleNetwork.getFiatCoin`. By default, this is set to USD.

| Field      | Type       | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fiatCoin` | `FiatCoin` | The specific fiat currency in which value is denominated. This can be either `.usd`, `.cny`, `.jpy`, `.hkd`, `.inr`, `.krw`. |

```swift
ParticleNetwork.setFiatCoin(FiatCoin.usd)

ParticleNetwork.getFiatCoin()
```

### Enable Blind Signing

Silently sign messages/transactions, this switch will work if the following conditions are met:
