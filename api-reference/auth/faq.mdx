  <Accordion title="What is the validity period of your token?" icon="calendar-check">
    **Answer:** The validity period of the token is currently under review. We will update this section with the correct information once it is confirmed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I ensure the signature result is consistent each time?" icon="signature">
    **Answer:** Due to the unique characteristics of Multi-Party Computation (MPC), the signature result for the same message can vary each time, unlike traditional private key wallets such as MetaMask. 
    
    To address scenarios requiring a consistent signature result, we provide the `uniq` parameter. This parameter ensures that the signature remains consistent every time you sign the same message.

    ```tsx App.tsx
    // Sign a message with the uniq flag
    const result = await signMessage(message, true);
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I silently log in and sign messages/transactions?" icon="key">
    **Answer:** Currently, silent login and signing are not directly supported. However, this functionality can be achieved using [session keys](/guides/integrations/aa/keys#implementing-session-keys) with Biconomy V2. We are exploring other options to support silent signing in the future.

  <Accordion title="How do I determine if an account is new?" icon="user-plus">
    **Answer:** When you retrieve `UserInfo`, either through the `connect` method or via the `userInfo` object from `useAuthCore`, a field provide the relevant information:

    - **Account Creation:** The `created_at` field indicates the timestamp when the account was created.

  <Accordion title="How can I check the status of the main password and payment password settings?" icon="lock">
    **Answer:** The `userInfo` object contains a `security_account` property, which includes two fields:

    - `has_set_payment_password`: Indicates if the payment password is set.
