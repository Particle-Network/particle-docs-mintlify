## 1. What is the validity period of your token?

*Answer:* The validity period of the token is currently under review. We will update this section with the correct information once it is confirmed.

---

## 2. How can I ensure the signature result is consistent each time?

*Answer:* Due to the unique characteristics of Multi-Party Computation (MPC), the signature result for the same message can vary each time, unlike traditional private key wallets such as MetaMask. To address scenarios requiring a consistent signature result, we provide the `uniq` parameter. This parameter ensures that the signature remains consistent every time you sign the same message.

---

## 3. How can I silently log in and sign messages/transactions?

*Answer:* Currently, silent login and signing are not directly supported. However, this functionality can be achieved using [session keys](/guides/integrations/aa/keys#implementing-session-keys) with Biconomy V2. We are exploring other options to support silent signing in the future.

---

## 4. How do I determine if an account is new? 

*Answer:* When you retrieve `UserInfo`, either through the `connect` method or via the `userInfo` object from `useAuthCore`, several fields provide relevant information:

- **Account Creation:** The `created_at` field indicates the timestamp when the account was created.

<Note>Find more about Handling User Information in the [Particle Auth SDK](/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web#handling-user-information) page.</Note>

## 5. How can I check the status of the main password and payment password settings?

The `userInfo` object contains a `security_account` property, which includes two fields:
  - `has_set_master_password`: Indicates if the master password is set.
  - `has_set_payment_password`: Indicates if the payment password is set.

## 6. Why does Google login prompt me that I do not comply with the policy?

*Answer:* This issue typically occurs when using Google login within a WebView environment.
