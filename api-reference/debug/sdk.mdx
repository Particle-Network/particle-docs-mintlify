## Understanding SDK Errors

Within Particle Network's SDKs, errors are almost always caught for SDK-related issues, meaning problems related to configuration, compatibility, initialization, etc.

For non-SDK related issues that may stem from external factors within your application (such as webpack/vite/etc. configurations, npm or yarn problems, etc.), you'll need to troubleshoot these manually or reach out to us through the [Particle Network Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2y44qr6CR2). 

Additionally, the error you're looking for may be present within [Common API Errors](/api-reference/debug/api).

## Particle AA SDK

| Error message                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Component                                 |

| "Please configure the smart account contract first"                      | When calling specific functions that require the context of an initialized smart account, you may encounter this error. To alleviate it, you'll need to ensure you've already constructed a valid instance of `SmartAccount` with a specific smart account chosen.                                                                                                                          | setSmartAccountContract, getAccountConfig |
| "Current chain is not supported, chainId: {}, please configure it first" | Upon assigning a smart account within `SmartAccount` and choosing a specific `chainId` (through `chainIds`), you may encounter this issue if the chain you're attempting to use to initialize the smart account is not supported by that implementation. Remember that different account implementations (SimpleAccount, Biconomy, CyberConnect) are each compatible with different chains. | getAccountConfig                          |
| "Only BICONOMY 2.0.0 is supported"                                       | Session keys are currently supported on instances of `BICONOMY 2.0.0`. When attempting to call `createSessions` or `validateSession` on different account implementations, this error will be thrown. Ensure `SmartAccount` is configured to use `biconomy` version `2.0.0`.                                                                                                                | createSessions, validateSession           |
| "sendTxMode value error, must be in {}"                                  | When setting `SendTransactionMode` on `AAWrapProvider`, you'll need to use either `SendTransactionMode.Gasless`, `SendTransactionMode.UserPaidNative`, or `SendTransactionMode.UserSelect`, otherwise this error will be thrown.                                                                                                                                                            | AAWrapProvider                            |
| "AA21 didn't pay prefund"                                                | This is a generic error a Bundler issues when a given smart account does not have the funds for a user operation. In this case, it will most likely occur upon account initialization (the first UserOperation sent by the wallet). Ensure you're either sponsoring the gas fees or have funded the account.                                                                                | _Generic_                                 |
| "AA31 paymaster deposit too low"                                         | AA31 stems from insufficient funds within the Paymaster to sponsor a given transaction. Ensure you've funded the Particle Paymaster (or Biconomy Paymaster) with USDT on either Ethereum or BNB Chain. Your USDT will be automatically converted for multi-chain sponsorships.                                                                                                              | _Generic_                                 |
| "AA25 Invalid Account Nonce"                                             | While unlikely to occur within Particle's AA SDK, there may be scenarios in which nonce management is disrupted, resulting in this error. This may happen if you're sending large volumes of UserOperations from a single account in a short time or if network issues are present and thus an invalid nonce is being returned to the backend of the SDK.                                   | _Generic_                                 |
| "AA{}{}"                                                                 | Other issues of this nature (AA{}{}), stem directly from the invalid construction or execution of a UserOperation. Feel free to reach out within the [Particle Network Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2y44qr6CR2) for more assistance.                                                                                                                                                 | _Generic_                                 |
| "Account Abstraction Error"                                              | This often acts as the prefix for a generic AA error, such as `AA21 didn't pay prefund`, or other related issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | _Generic_                                 |
