## Particle Connect for iOS

Integrating Particle Connect into your iOS application allows for seamless onboarding, combining Web2-like and Web3-native experiences. It functions as an **SSO for Web3**, unifying various onboarding methods within a customizable in-house connection modal. 

This includes options for Web3 accounts via social logins, Web3 wallets through WalletConnect and Solana's `wallet-adapter`, and direct private key imports. Particle Connect on iOS aims to provide a universally accessible gateway into mobile dApps.

Implementing Particle Connect in your iOS application is straightforward, as detailed below.

## Repository

Before starting the configuration and usage process, explore our demo repository to understand the architecture and implementation flow. You can find the official [Particle Connect iOS SDK repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-connect-ios).

<Warning>
 Using a private key or the mnemonic
 import/generate function is strongly discouraged. If you use it, you need to secure the data yourself,
 as Particle doesn't have a relationship with the imported/generated mnemonic
 or private key.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The setup process on iOS can be somewhat lengthy, so to ensure you don't run into any compatibility issues and can get started as soon as possible, you'll need to confirm that your project meets several different prerequisites:

- **Xcode 15.0** or higher
- **CocoaPods 1.14.3** or higher
- **iOS 14** or higher

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

Additionally, before diving in, you'll need to retrieve three universally required values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`. These directly link your project (instance of Particle Connect) with the Particle dashboard to enable customization, analytics, tracking, etc.

<Note>
  Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys:
  [Create a new
  project](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/connect/ios-quickstart).
</Note>

### Dependencies

The **Podfile** is a critical element of the **Particle Connect** integration. It's where you declare the numerous dependencies required. This file serves as a roadmap for the pods (packages) to be used within your application.

It's crucial to have a **Podfile** in place. If you don't have one, head over to the root of your project directly to create one. Run the following command to get started:

```shell Terminal
pod init
```

Then, within your Podfile, you'll need to throw in a few different dependencies, the specifics of which depend on the functions of Particle Connect that you'd like to use.

## Connect V2

<Note>We recommend trying our [Particle Connect Demo](https://demo.particle.network) to easily customize and design your connect page. After customizing, you can copy the generated code from the Code Snippets section and paste it into the [ConnectKitDemo](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-connect-ios/tree/master/ConnectKitDemo) to experience it directly in your app.</Note>

Starting from version 2.0.0, you can quickly integrate the `ParticleConnectKit` SDK, which includes features such as social login, SNS login, third-party wallet login, and customizable login UI.

```ruby Podfile
pod `ParticleConnectKit`
pod 'AuthCoreAdapter'
pod 'ParticleConnect'
pod 'ConnectPhantomAdapter'
pod 'ConnectWalletConnectAdapter'
pod 'ConnectCommon'
```

## Connect V1 (Legacy)

1. Regardless of specific functions, you'll need `ConnectCommon` and `ParticleConnect`, alongside `AuthCoreAdapter`.
2. If you'd like to support importing (or generating fresh) wallets on EVM chains, you'll need `ConnectEVMAdapter`.
   1. To do the same on Solana, use `ConnectSolanaAdapter`.
3. To support connection with Phantom (on Solana), you'll need to use `ConnectPhantomAdapter`
4. For general WalletConnect-based connection, you can use `ConnectWalletConnectAdapter`:

```ruby Podfile
pod 'ConnectCommon'
pod 'ParticleConnect'
pod 'ConnectWalletConnectAdapter'
pod 'ConnectEVMAdapter'
pod 'ConnectSolanaAdapter'
pod 'ConnectPhantomAdapter'
pod 'AuthCoreAdapter'
```

With this set, you can simply run the following command to ensure changes are saved:

```shell Terminal
pod install --repo-update
open your-project.xcworkspace
```

Before continuing, paste the following code into your Podfile if it is not already present; this is required for utilizing Particle Connect. Otherwise, you'll encounter issues.

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
      end
    end
end
```

### Configuration

Now that you've retrieved your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` from the Particle dashboard and also set up your Podfile, it's time to move on to the core configuration of your project before diving into examples of utilization. To begin this process, configure a `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist` file.

Since it's likely not already present, head to the root of your project and make a blank file, `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`

Within this file, you must enter the authentication credentials retrieved from the Particle dashboard. You can do this through the structure below:

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Additionally, head over to your `UIApplicationDelegate`. You'll need to import the various libraries previously declared within your Podfile at the top of the file. An example of this can be seen below:

```swift
import AuthCoreAdapter
import ConnectCommon
import ConnectPhantomAdapter
import ConnectWalletConnectAdapter
import ParticleNetworkBase
import ParticleNetworkChains
import ParticleConnect
```

### Initialization

Now that these are set, you'll need to initialize Particle Connect itself (within `UIApplicationDelegate`). Particle Connect will not function until initialization is complete (and valid). Essentially, initialization involves declaring specific imported adapters, the chain to be used, and application metadata.

Specifically, `ParticleConnect.initialize` takes the following parameters:

| Field       | Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `env`       | `DevEnvironment`   | The specific environment to be used. This can be either `.debug`, `.staging`, or `.production`; it should be set to `.production` when released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `chainInfo` | `ChainInfo`        | The primary chain to be used within your application. It should include an overall blockchain and a specific network. In this example, it's `.ethereum`(alternatively, it could be `.ethereumSepolia`, and so on).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `dAppData`  | `DAppMetadata`     | Metadata outlining the description of your application; this should be an instance of `DAppMetadata` with the following parameters: `name`, the name of your project. `icon`, a URL linking to the icon of your project; this should be 512x512, ideally. `url`, the URL of your project's website. `description`, the description of your project, `redirectUniversalLink`, optional, redirect universal link for your project, default is `DAppMetadata.standard`. |
| `adapters`  | `[ConnectAdapter]` | You'll need to pass a list of adapters to be offered within the connection modal. This can be defined as a simple array containing various imported adapters (such as `AuthCoreAdapter`, `MetaMaskConnectAdapter`, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

An **example** of initialization can be found below.

```swift
var adapters: [ConnectAdapter] = [
       AuthCoreAdaper(),
       WalletConnectAdapter(),
       MetaMaskConnectAdapter(),
       PhantomConnectAdapter(),
       ImtokenConnectAdapter(),
       BitgetConnectAdapter(),
       RainbowConnectAdapter(),
       TrustConnectAdapter(),
		   ZerionConnectAdapter(),
       MathConnectAdapter(),
       Inch1ConnectAdapter(),
       ZengoConnectAdapter(),
       AlphaConnectAdapter(),
       OKXConnectAdapter()
       ]

ParticleConnect.initialize(env: .debug, chainInfo: .ethereumSepolia, dAppData: .standard, adapters: adapters)
```

### Scheme Configuration

The final step in setting up your iOS project is configuring a scheme URL and `LSAApplicationQueriesSchemes` within your application. Beginning with the scheme URL, add the following to your dApp's `application(_:open:options:)` method:

```swift
return ParticleConnect.handleUrl(url)
```

From there, you'll need to configure the scheme URL itself; select your application target within the "Info" section, add a URL type, and include the scheme. **This scheme should be `pn` added to your `appId`.**

For example, if your `appId` is `63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, then the scheme URL would be `pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f` --simply adding `pn` to the beginning of the `appId`.

With the scheme URL configured, you'll also need to head into `info.plist` and add `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` according to your specific utilization of Web3 wallets (not Particle Auth, but independent wallet adapters). An example of this can be seen below (each of these is optional and dependent upon your given implementation)

```xml Info.plist
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
<string>metamask</string>
<string>phantom</string>
<string>bitkeep</string>
<string>imtokenv2</string>
<string>rainbow</string>
<string>trust</string>
<string>zerion</string>
<string>mathwallet</string>
<string>oneinch</string>
<string>awallet</string>
<string>okex</string>
<string>bnc</string>
</array>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access in order to open photos of barcodes</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use the camera to scan barcodes</string>
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use Face ID for secure access to the app.</string>
```

## Examples of Utilization

### Utilization of WalletConnect V2

You can set specific chains within WalletConnect (`chainInfo` structures) with `setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos`. An example of this can be found below.

```swift
ParticleConnect.setWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos([.ethereum, .polygon])
```

### Get all Wallet Adapter

To retrieve all wallet adapters either in total, by `chainType` (`evm` or `solana`), or by address, you'll need to call one of the following methods:

- `ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters`, returns all adapters (for every address and `chainType`).
- `ParticleConnect.getAdapters`, retrieves adapters by `chainType` (`evm` or `solana`).
- `ParticleConnect.getAdapterByAddress`, returns all adapters associated with a specific (user) public address.

```swift
let adapter = ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters()
            .filter { $0.walletType == .authCore }.first

let adapters = ParticleConnect.getAdapters(chainType: .evm)

let adapters = ParticleConnect.getAdapterByAddress(publicAddress: address)
```

### Get Adapter Accounts

`adapter.getAccounts` returns a list of accounts associated/connected with a specific adapter. `adapter` is an instance of a given wallet adapter, such as `AuthCoreAdapter`. Each adapter has a `getAccounts` method by default. Alternatively, you'll need to call `adapter.getSmartAccounts` to retrieve smart accounts associated with a given adapter. E.g.:

```swift
let accounts = adapter.getAccounts()

// Alternatively
let smartAccounts = try await adapter.getSmartAccounts()
```

### Switch Chain

Often, the primary chain initially set through `initialize` won't be the _only_ chain used within your application; thus, to account for this and change the primary chain post-initialization, you can call `ParticleNetwork.setChainInfo`, passing in a `chainInfo` object, as shown in the example below.

`WalletType.authCore` comes from Particle Auth Core and supports EVM and Solana. 

If you need a switch chain for one of the two accounts and need to switch from Solana to EVM or EVM to Solana, you can call `(adapter as! ParticleAdapter).switchChain`.

```swift
ParticleNetwork.setChainInfo(.ethereum)

// Switch chains, such as between Solana and Ethereum.
// Ensure the adapter.walletType is authCore or particle.
let result = try await (adapter as! ParticleAdapter).switchChain(.ethereum).value
```

### Connect Wallet V2

`ParticleConnectUI.connect` is a one-click login function that integrates a customizable login UI. The parameter config can be derived from `ConnectKitConfig`.

`ConnectKitConfig.init` allows these parameters:

| Field                     | Type                      | Description                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `connectOptions`          | `[ConnectOption]`         | `connectOptions` supports `email`, `phone`, `social` and `wallet`, the sort order is used for the Connect Kit login UI.       |
| `socialProviders`         | `[EnableSocialProvider]`  | `socialProviders` supports `google`, `apple` and other social options, the sort order is used for the Connect Kit login UI.   |
| `walletProviders`         | `[EnableWalletProvider]`  | `walletProviders` supports `metamask`, `trust` and other wallet options, the sort order is used for the Connect Kit login UI. |
| `additionalLayoutOptions` | `AdditionalLayoutOptions` | Layout options.                                                                                                           |
| `designOptions`           | `DesignOptions`           | Design options.                                                                                                           |

```swift
let config = ConnectKitConfig(connectOptions: connectOptions, socialProviders: socialProviders, walletProviders: walletProviders, additionalLayoutOptions: additionalLayoutOptions, designOptions: designOptions)
let account = try await ParticleConnectUI.connect(config: config).value
```

### Connect Wallet V1 (Legacy)

Specific adapters can initiate the connection (through an initialization in a variable such as `adapter`) with the `connect` method. This method will display a modal facilitating connection depending on the specific adapter.

For `EVMConnectAdapter` and `SolanaConnectAdapter`, the 'connect' method will initiate a connection and generate a fresh account (public and private key pair). Otherwise, the specific connection flow will be dependent upon the adapter in which `connect` is called. E.g.:

| Field    | Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config` | `ConnectConifg?` | The `ConnectConfig` will only be effective when `adapter.walletType` is `.authCore`. You can construct a valid object using the subclass `ParticleAuthCoreConfig`. When `adapter.walletType` is another value, you can pass `ConnectConfig.none`. |

`ParticleAuthCoreConfig` construct method `init` support the following parameters:

| Field               | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loginType`         | `LoginType`          | The specific social login to be used. This can be either `.email`, `.phone`, `.google`, `.apple`, `.jwt`, `.facebook`, `.twitter`, `.discord`, `.github`, `.twitch`, `.microsoft` or `linkedin`.                                                                                 |
| `supportAuthType`   | `[SupportAuthType]`  | The methods of authentication visible on the authentication popup UI. By default, this will be exclusive to the chosen social login method, although by passing in additional types, you can expand the UI to include the ability to login with those as an alternative to type. |
| `account`           | `String?`            | (Optional) when `type` is set to either `.email`, `.phone`, or `.jwt`, you can use the `account` parameter to pass in an expected email, phone number, or JWT. This is optional for the former two, but required for `.jwt`. The phone number must be in E.164 format.           |
| `code`              | `String?`            | (Optional) when `type` is set to either `.email` pr `.phone`, you can use the code parameter to pass the verification code.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `socialLoginPrompt` | `SocialLoginPrompt?` | (Optional) either `.none`, `.consent`, or `.select_account`                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `loginPageConfig`   | `LoginPageConfig?`   | (Optional) to customize the UI page, contains project name, icon and description.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

<Tip>You can use your existing user base or authentication method with Particle Connect through JWT. This way, your users can still log in with their current accounts. Check the [JWT guide](/guides/configuration/auth/jwt) to learn how to configure JWT. </Tip>


```swift

// Retrieve and use MetaMask adapter
let adapter = ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters().first { $0.walletType == .metaMask }!
let account = try await adapter.connect(ConnectConfig.none).value

// Retrieve and use Particle (social login) adapter
let adapter = ParticleConnect.getAllAdapters().first { $0.walletType == .authCore }!
let account = try await adapter.connect(ParticleAuthCoreConfig(loginType: .google, socialLoginPrompt: .selectAccount)).value
```

Only after connecting with **Particle Connect** is successful can you retrieve `userInfo` by calling the `(adapter as! ParticleAdapter).getUserInfo` method; other wallet types can't call this method.

```swift
let userInfo = (adapter as! ParticleAdapter).getUserInfo
```

### Disconnect Wallet

Alternatively, if a user has already connected their wallet, you can use `disconnect` as the primary method to disconnect a user within an active session. This will be relatively universal across adapters. E.g.:

| Field           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other walletTypes, you need pass a connected public address. |

```swift
let result = try await adapter.disconnect(address).value
```

### Is Connected

Another quite important method is `isConnected`, returning a Boolean based on whether or not a given session (user) is currently connected to a wallet (through the specific adapter instance). `adapter.isConnected` takes a given public address and returns `true` or `false` depending on its connection status. E.g.:

| Field           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other `walletTypes`, you need to pass a connected public address. |

```swift
let result = adapter.isConnected(publicAddress: address)
```

<Note>
<p>If the account originates from `.authCore`, it's recommended to directly use `auth.isConnected` to check the user's login status.</p>
```swift
import ParticleAuthCore

let auth = Auth()
let result = try await auth.isConnected()

````
</Note>

### Import Wallet

If you're using `EVMConnectAdapter` or `SolanaConnectAdapter`, you can import wallets through either a seed phrase or private key. 

These methods will associate an account instance derived from these keys, allowing utilization within your application. These can be achieved through either `importWalletFromPrivateKey` for importing a private key or `importWalletFromMnemonic` for importing a mnemonic (seed phrase).

Additionally, you can export one of these wallets with `adapter.exportWalletPrivateKey`, passing in the address (of the `EVMConnectAdapter` or `SolanaConnectAdapter` imported/generated wallet) that you'd like to export.

<Note>
<p>This is not the import/export of wallets within Particle Auth; Particle Network's MPC-TSS accounts do not support importing or exporting private keys.</p>
<p>This is specific to a custom account connection with Particle Connect.</p>
</Note>

```swift
let account = try await adapter.importWalletFromPrivateKey(privateKey).value

let account = try await adapter.importWalletFromMnemonic(mnemonic).value

// Exportation
let privateKey = try await adapter.exportWalletPrivateKey(publicAddress: address).value
````

### Sign and Send Transaction

To initiate a signature and complete an on-chain settlement, use `adapter.signAndSendTransaction`—the primary method for sending transactions through **Particle Connect** for **EVM** and **Solana** networks. When you call this method, a popup will appear in the specified adapter, prompting the user to provide a signature. Once the user confirms, the transaction is immediately sent to the network.

The `adapter.signAndSendTransaction` method accepts the following parameters:


| Field           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other wallet`Types, you need to pass a connected public address. |
| `transaction`   | `String` | An EVM transaction is expressed as a hexadecimal string, a Solana transaction is expressed as a base58 string.                                                            |

```swift
let txHash = try await adapter.signAndSendTransaction(publicAddress: address, transaction: transaction).value
```

You can create an EVM transaction with class `TxData` or `FeeMarketEIP1559TxData`, and also you can use another SDK, `ParticleWalletAPI`, to create a transaction, you can reference the examples from [Wallet SDK reference](/api-reference/wallet/mobile/ios)

### Sign Transaction

`adapter.signTransaction` is a **Solana-specific** method for signing a transaction without pushing it to the network. Specifically, this method requires the following parameters:

| Field           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other `walletTypes`, you need to pass a connected public address. |
| `transaction`   | `String` | A base58 string representing a transaction object.                                                                                                                   |

This will return a popup requesting confirmation to either `SolanaConnectAdapter` or `PhantomConnectAdapter` depending on which you've defined as `adapter` (or a custom adapter you've set up). E.g.:

```swift
let signed = try await adapter.signTransaction(publicAddress: address, transaction: transaction).value

// Alternatively, the plural form of this method, takes a list of transactions
let signeds = try await adapter.signAllTransactions(publicAddress: address, transactions: transactions).value
```

### Sign Message (EIP191)

To sign a basic UTF-8 message (string), you can use `adapter.signMessage` to prompt the user for a signature alongside the message in question. `adapter.signMessage` takes the following parameters:

| Field           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other `walletTypes`, you need to pass a connected public address.                |
| `message`       | `String` | The message you'd like the user to sign; for EVM, this should be a hex-encoded string (prefixed by '0x'), while for Solana, you can pass a standard string (no encoding needed). |

```swift
let signed = try await adapter.signMessage(publicAddress: address, message: message).value
```

### Sign Typed Data V4 (EIP712)

As an alternative to `signMessage`, for **EVM chains**, you can request that a user signs typed (structured) data rather than purely a raw string. You can use `adapter.signTypedData` (equivalent to `eth_signTypedData` V4) to do this. This takes the following parameters:

| Field           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `publicAddress` | `String` | The connected public address, if `adapter.WalletType` is `.authCore`, you can pass an empty string, for other `walletTypes`, you need to pass a connected public address. |
| `data`          | `String` | The typed data to be signed; see the [Web (JavaScript/TypeScript)](/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web) page for additional guidance.                               |

```swift
let signed = try await adapter.signTypedData(publicAddress: publicAddress, data: message).value
```

### (Optional) Custom WalletConnect Projcet ID

```swift
ParticleConnect.setWalletConnectV2ProjectId("WalletConnect V2 Project ID")
```

### Custom WalletConnect Adapter

There may be cases where the existing selection of adapters doesn't include a wallet you'd like to be featured within Particle Connect. 

Creating a custom adapter (using `WalletConnectAdapter` as the parent class) is quite simple in this situation. Doing so will require a structure similar to the example below, in which a custom Coin98 adapter is made by overriding `walletType` with a custom `AdapterInfo` instance.

```swift
public class Coin98WalletConnectAdapter: WalletConnectAdapter {
  public override var walletType: WalletType {
      return WalletType.custom(info: AdapterInfo.init(name: "Coin98",
                   url: "https://coin98.com/",
                   icon: "https://registry.walletconnect.com/v2/logo/md/dee547be-936a-4c92-9e3f-7a2350a62e00",
                   redirectUrlHost: "coin98",
                   supportChains: [.evm],
                   deepLink: "coin98://", // Requires either universal link or scheme
                   scheme: "coin98://"))
  }
}
```

## Dive Deeper

`ParticleConnect` includes `ParticleAuthCore`. If you log in with a Particle account, you can access additional functions such as `getUserInfo`, `openAccountAndSecurity`, `hasMasterPassword` and `hasPaymentPassword` and `changeMasterPassword`, you can reference the docs from [Auth SDK reference](/api-reference/auth/mobile-sdks/ios).
