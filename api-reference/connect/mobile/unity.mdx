## Particle Connect for Unity

**Particle Connect** acts as a central wallet connection mechanism within games built on **Unity**. 

With it, you can onboard users into a functional account through social logins (via **Particle Auth**) or typical Web3 wallets (via WalletConnect, Solana's `wallet-adapter`, or private key imports). This creates a Web2-adjacent login experience while retaining unified compatibility with existing popular Web3 wallets.

**Particle Connect** has a dedicated **Unity** SDK for integration; the configuration process and examples of utilization **are outlined below.**

## Repository

Before diving in, all of the Particle Network **Unity** SDKs (for **Particle Auth** and **Particle Connect**) are publicly available and viewable through the [official repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity). Feel free to look at the underlying architecture and demos showcasing end-to-end implementation to gain an initial understanding of working with **Particle Connect** on **Unity**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Your **Unity** project must meet several requirements to avoid compatibility issues. These requirements will be, in some capacity, dependent on the platform that you've decided to use. They are as follows:

- **Unity 2022.3.43f1** or higher.
- If you're using iOS:
  - **Xcode 15.0** or higher.
  - **CocoaPods 1.14.3** or higher.
  - **iOS 14** or higher.
- If you're using Android:
  - minSdkVersion **23** or higher.
  - compileSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion **34** or higher.
  - JavaVersion **17**.
  - [Jetpack (AndroidX)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate?authuser=0).
  - Android Gradle Plugin Version : 8.5.1 or higher.
  - Gradle Version : 8.9 or higher.

### Setting up the Particle dashboard

Once you've ensured that your project meets the above prerequisites, you'll also need three key values from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network): your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`.

These connect your **Unity** project directly with the Particle dashboard, enabling customization, analytics, tracking, etc.

<Note>
  Follow the quickstart tutorial to set up a project and find the required keys:
  [Create a new
  project](/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/mobile-quickstart#configuring-particle-auth).
</Note>

### Configuration

With these values in hand, you can move on to initial configuration and dependency management, which will vary in complexity depending on the platform used. To begin, for both iOS and Android, you'll need to download and install the Particle Unity package, which will include the necessary files for both Particle Connect and Particle Auth.

Head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/releases), and download the latest release (`.unitypackage`), then import this into your project.

#### iOS configuration

If you're building a Unity game on iOS, you must follow a specific configuration process to ensure that Particle Connect functions. The first step within this process is to set up a scheme URL within the Unity editor.

1. Head into the [iOS Player Settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsiOS.html) menu (`Edit` -> `Project Settings` -> `Player Settings` -> `iOS`).
2. From here, select `Other`, then scroll down to `Configuration`.
3. Open the `Supported URL schemes` section, and within the `Element 0` field, paste in your `projectId` with a prefix of `pn`.
   1. For example, if your `projectId` (from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network)) is something like `63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`, then the scheme URL, in this case, would be `pn63bfa427-cf5f-4742-9ff1-e8f5a1b9828f`

<Note>
  <p>Remove other services, if needed</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    Within `ParticleNetworkIOSBridge.cs`, you'll have a number of services
    included in the SDK:
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- `ParticleNetworkBase` - required universally.</p>
  <p>- `ParticleAuthCore` - required for Particle Auth Core.</p>
  <p>- `ParticleConnect`- required for Particle Connect.</p>
  <p>
    - `ParticleWalletGUI` - usage of the Particle Wallet UI, contains all
    services.
  </p>
  <p>- `ParticleAA` - usage of the Particle AA, contains all services.</p>
</Note>

You'll also need to configure your Podfile if you haven't already. To do so, go to the root of your project directory and run `pod init`; this will generate a Podfile.

Open this Podfile, and insert the specific pods (services) you'd like to use within your project. In this case, `ParticleConnect` and `CommonConnect` will generally suffice, but additional services can be added if needed.

Additionally, you'll need to paste in the code snippet below for installation handling:

```ruby Podfile
pod 'ParticleConnect'
pod 'CommonConnect'

// Paste this
post_install do |installer|
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
  target.build_configurations.each do |config|
  config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
 end
```

You can also copy the example [Podfile](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-unity/blob/main/ios-build/Podfile).

With your Podfile set, you'll need to run `pod install` and open your `.xcworkspace` file, as shown below:

```shell Terminal
pod install --repo-update

open {your project}.xcworkspace
```

Finally, for **iOS**, you'll need to formally use the `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` previously retrieved. To do this, head to the root of your **Xcode** project and create a file called `ParticleNetwork-Info.plist`. Within this file, paste the following text (then replace the placeholders):

```xml ParticleNetwork-Info.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PROJECT_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_UUID</string>
	<key>PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_CLIENT_KEY</string>
	<key>PROJECT_APP_UUID</key>
	<string>YOUR_PROJECT_APP_UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### Android configuration

If you're building your **Unity** game for **Android**, you'll just need to configure two files before you're ready to go. The first of these two files can be found at `Assets/Plugins/Android/launcherTemplate.gradle` within your project. Here, you'll need to ensure you have the necessary dependencies included.

Specifically, you'll need the following dependencies at a minimum:

- `network.particle:auth-service`if you're planning on using Particle Auth directly.
- `network.particle:connect`, required for Particle Connect.
- `network.particle:unity-bridge`, required universally.
- Additional dependencies, optional:
  - `network.particle:chains`, collection of `chainInfo` objects.
  - `network.particle:connect-solana-adapter`, Solana-specific custom wallet adapter to be used within Particle Connect.
  - `network.particle:connect-phantom-adapter`, Wallet adapter for Phantom to be used within Particle Connect.
  - `network.particle:connect-evm-adapter`, EVM-specific custom wallet adapter to be used within Particle Connect.
  - `network.particle:connect-auth-adapter`, Particle Auth adapter for Particle Connect (social logins).
  - `network.particle:connect-wallet-connect-adapter`, WalletConnect adapter for Particle Connect.
    The full list of `network.particle` packages can be found [here](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=g:network.particle&smo=true).

```groovy launcherTemplate.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation project(':unityLibrary')
    implementation "network.particle:auth-service:${sdkVersion}"
    implementation "network.particle:unity-bridge:${sdkVersion}"
  	implementation "network.particle:connect:${sdkVersion}"
  	// Other dependencies
}
```

Finally, for **Android**, you'll need to place your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` within `gradleTemplate.properties`, which can be found at `Assets/Plugins/Android/gradleTemplate.properties`.

```groovy gradleTemplate.properties
particle.network.project_client_key=Your Client Key
particle.network.project_id=Your Project ID
particle.network.app_id=Your App ID
```

---

## Initialization

Now that you've managed the relevant dependencies and configured your Unity environment, you'll need to initialize `ParticleNetwork` and `ParticleConnectInteraction` (derived from `Network.Particle.Scripts.Core`) before moving on. This is required for Particle Connect to function.

`ParticleNetwork` can be initialized by simply calling `Init` and passing in a `chainInfo` object (\*). `ParticleConnectInteraction.Init` will require both a `chainInfo` object and a `DAppMetaData` parameter (in this example, represented as `metadata`) containing a WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the WalletConnect dashboard, alongside the name of your project, the icon (preferably 512x512), the website URL, and a project description.

Additionally, with WalletConnect as the underlying infrastructure for Web3 wallets within Particle Connect, you'll also have the opportunity to include configuration for multiple different chains on WalletConnect by calling `ParticleConnectInteraction.SetWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos` and passing in an array of `chainInfo` objects.

An example of the above process can be found below.

| Field       | Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `chainInfo` | `ChainInfo`    | The primary chain to be used within your application. This should be indicated by an overall blockchain, followed by a specific network. Within this example, it's `.Ethereum`(alternatively it could be `.EthereumSepolia`, and so on.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `dAppData`  | `DAppMetadata` | Metadata that describes your application and should be provided as an instance of `DAppMetadata` with the following parameters: `walletConnectProjectId`, the WalletConnect project ID retrieved from the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com), `name`, the name of your project. `icon`, a URL linking to the icon of your project; this should be 512x512, ideally. `url`, the URL of your project's website. `description`, the description of your project, `redirect`, optional, a redirect universal link to you project, `verifyUrl`, optional. |
| `rpcUrl`    | `RpcUrl?`      | Customize the RPC URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `env`       | `Env`          | The specific environment to be used. This can be either `.DEV`, `.STAGING`, `.PRODUCTION`, this should be set to `.PRODUCTION` when released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

```csharp
var metadata = new DAppMetaData(TestConfig.walletConnectProjectId,"Particle Connect",
            "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png",
            "https://connect.particle.network",
            "Particle Unity Demo");

ParticleNetwork.Init(ChainInfo.Ethereum);
ParticleConnectInteraction.Init(ChainInfo.Ethereum, metadata);
```

Additionally, if you'd like to define multiple chains to be available through WalletConnect, you'll need to create an array of `ChainInfo` objects (`chainInfos` in this example) and use it within `ParticleConnectInteraction.SetWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos`. E.g.:

```csharp
List<ChainInfo> chainInfos = new List<ChainInfo>
                { ChainInfo.Ethereum, ChainInfo.EthereumSepolia, ChainInfo.EthereumSepolia };
ParticleConnectInteraction.SetWalletConnectV2SupportChainInfos(chainInfos.ToArray());
```

---

## Examples of Utilization

### Set Chain Info

If you want to set the primary chain after initializing with `.Init` and before a user is connected, you can call `ParticleNetwork.SetChainInfo`, passing in the appropriate `chainInfo` object for the desired chain.

If your application supports only EVM chains, `ParticleNetwork.SetChainInfo` is sufficient and can be called anytime. However, if you support both EVM and Solana chains, use `ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SwitchChain` when switching between EVM and Solana chains. For example:

```csharp
ParticleNetwork.SetChainInfo(ChainInfo.Ethereum);

// Alternatively, if you are using WalletType.authCore
await ParticleAuthCore.Instance.SwitchChain(ChainInfo.Ethereum);
```

---

### Connect Wallet

Within implementations of **Particle Connect**, `Connect` drives connection with a wallet in the **Particle Connect** stack, (social login or otherwise.) This is done through `ParticleConnect.Instance.Connect`, then passing in a relevant `WalletType` object, derived from `Network.Particle.Scripts.Model`

`WalletType` is an `enum` containing the following choices:

- `AuthCore`, Particle Auth Core, an alternative to Particle Auth (`Particle`).
- `EvmPrivateKey`, custom EVM wallet imports/exports.
- `SolanaPrivateKey`, custom Solana wallet imports/exports.
- `MetaMask`.
- `Rainbow`.
- `Trust`.
- `ImToken`.
- `Bitget`.
- `WalletConnect`.
- `Zerion`.
- `Math`.
- `Inch1`.
- `Zengo`.
- `Alpha`.
- `OKX`.
- `TokenPocket`, not supported by iOS.
- `Phantom`, intended for Solana.

If you're using `AuthCore`, you'll also need to pass in a `ConnectConfig` object containing:

| Field               | Type                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loginType`         | `LoginType`               | The specific social login to be used. This can be either `.EMAIL`, `.PHONE`, `.GOOGLE`, `.FACEBOOK`, `.APPLE`, `.TWITTER`, `.DISCORD`, `.GITHUB`, `.TWITCH`, `.MICROSOFT`, `.LINKEDIN` or `JWT`.                                                                                 |
| `account`           | `string?`                 | (Optional) when `type` is set to either `.email`, `.phone`, or `.jwt`, you can use the `account` parameter to pass in an expected email, phone number, or JWT. This is optional for the former two, but required for `.jwt`. The phone number must be in E.164 format.           |
| `code`              | `string?`                 | (Optional) when `type` is set to either `.email` pr `.phone`, you can use the code parameter to pass the verification code.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `supportAuthTypes`  | `List<SupportLoginType>?` | The methods of authentication visible on the authentication popup UI. By default, this will be exclusive to the chosen social login method, although by passing in additional types, you can expand the UI to include the ability to login with those as an alternative to type. |
| `socialLoginPrompt` | `SocialLoginPrompt?`      | (Optional) either `.None`, `.Consent`, or `.SelectAccount`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `loginPageConfig`   | `LoginPageConfig?`        | (Optional) customize the UI page, includes project name, icon and description.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

E.g.:

```csharp
// Use social logins
var supportLoginTypes = new List<SupportLoginType> { SupportLoginType.APPLE, SupportLoginType.EMAIL, SupportLoginType.PHONE, SupportLoginType.GOOGLE};
var loginPageConfig = new LoginPageConfig("Particle Unity Example",
                "An example description", "https://connect.particle.network/icons/512.png");
ConnectConfig config = new ConnectConfig(LoginType.Email, "user@example.come", null, supportLoginTypes, SocialLoginPrompt.SelectAccount, loginPageConfig);
await ParticleConnect.Instance.Connect(WalletType.Particle, config);

// Use MetaMask or other supported wallet
await ParticleConnect.Instance.Connect(WalletType.MetaMask);
```

---

### Disconnect Wallet

To disconnect an active session identified by a specific address, you can call `ParticleConnect.Instance.Disconnect`, passing in the particular wallet type (`WalletType` object) and associated address that you'd like to disconnect from your application, as is shown below.

```csharp
await ParticleConnect.Instance.Disconnect(this._walletType, publicAddress);
```

---

### Is Connected

Another critical method is `IsConnected`, returning a Boolean indicating whether or not a user (or, in this case, an address and `WalletType`) is currently connected to your application. This can be called through `ParticleConnectInteraction.IsConnected`. E.g.:

```csharp
ParticleConnectInteraction.IsConnected(this._walletType, publicAddress);
```

---

### Sign and Send Transaction

`ParticleConnect.Instance.SignAndSendTransaction` is the primary mechanism for EVM and Solana to send (or, in this case, suggest) transactions. Upon calling, the `WalletType` (the adapter in question) will return a confirmation popup requesting a signature from the user before sending the transaction directly to the network. `SignAndSendTransaction` takes three parameters:

- `WalletType` is the type of wallet being used.
- `address` is the public address being used.
- `transaction,` a stringified representation of a transaction object.

E.g.:

```csharp
await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignAndSendTransaction(this._walletType, publicAddress, transaction);
```

---

### Sign Transaction

`ParticleConnect.Instance.SignTransaction` is a **Solana-specific** method for signing a transaction without pushing it to the network. This will behave similarly to `SignAndSendTransaction`, although it will only function on either the `Phantom` or `SolanaPrivateKey` wallet types and will purely return a signature.

The plural of this method is `ParticleConnect.Instance.SignAllTransactions`, which takes a list of transactions rather than just one to be prompted for signature.

```csharp
await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignTransaction(this._walletType, publicAddress, transaction);

// Alternatively
await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignAllTransactions(this._walletType, publicAddress, transactions);
```

---

### Sign Message

A simple message (UTF-8 string) can be signed on both EVM & Solana through `ParticleConnect.Instance.SignMessage`, passing in the `WalletType`, `address` (`publicAddress` in this example), and the `message` in question. `message` should be a general string to be signed. E.g.:

```csharp
var message = "GM, Particle!";
await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignMessage(this._walletType, publicAddress, message);
```

---

### Sign Typed Data

As an alternative to `SignMessage`, for **EVM chains**, you can request that a user signs typed (structured) data rather than purely a raw string. To do this, you can use `adapter.signTypedData` (equivalent to `eth_signTypedData`, represented as either `TypedDataV4`, `TypedDataV2`, or `TypedDataV1`). This takes the following parameters:

- `address` is the user address to target for signature initiation.
- `data`, the typed data to be signed; see the [Web (JavaScript/TypeScript)](/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web) page for additional guidance.

E.g.:

```csharp
var txtAsset = Resources.Load<TextAsset>("TypedDataV4");
string typedData = txtAsset.text;

await ParticleConnect.Instance.SignTypedData(this._walletType, publicAddress, typedData);
```

---

### Import Wallet

If you're using the`EvmPrivateKey` or `SolanaPrivateKey` wallet types, you can import wallets through either a seed phrase or private key. These methods will associate an account instance derived from these keys, allowing utilization within your application. 

These can be achieved through `ImportWalletFromPrivateKey` for importing a private key, or `ImportWalletFromMnemonic` for importing a mnemonic (seed phrase). These methods require the `WalletType` (either `EvmPrivateKey` or `SolanaPrivateKey`) and the private key/seed phrase to be imported.

Additionally, you can export one of these wallets with `ParticleConnect.Instance.ExportWalletPrivateKey`, passing in the address (of the `EvmPrivateKey` or `SolanaPrivateKey` imported/generated wallet) that you'd like to export.

```csharp
await ParticleConnect.Instance.ImportWalletFromPrivateKey(this._walletType, privateKey);

await ParticleConnect.Instance.ImportWalletFromMnemonic(this._walletType, mnemonic);

// Exportation
await ParticleConnect.Instance.ExportWalletPrivateKey(this._walletType, publicAddress);
```

`ParticleConnect` includes `ParticleAuthCore`. When logged in with a Particle account, you can access additional functions such as `getUserInfo`, `openAccountAndSecurity`, `hasMasterPassword`, `hasPaymentPassword`, and `changeMasterPassword`.
