# Particle Network Documentation

Particle Network provides the infrastructure for building **chain-agnostic, next-generation Web3 applications**.
Our stack consists of three core products:

1. **Universal Accounts**
   Universal Accounts enable any app to become chain-agnostic. They do so by providing users with a single account and unified balance across multiple chains.

   Thanks to this, users can spend their assets from multiple chains in a combined manner, use integrated dApps regardless of where their assets are or the chain the dApp is deployed on, and never manually bridge again.

   This user experience is known as [chain abstraction](https://developers.particle.network/intro/what-is-cha).
2. **Social Logins**
   Wallet creation and access with familiar Web2 credentials (Google, Twitter, Discord, etc.). This lowers onboarding friction and lets users start using dApps instantly.
3. **Account Abstraction (ERC-4337 AA)**
   Smart account infrastructure following the ERC-4337 standard.
   Features include gas sponsorship, batched transactions, and programmable account logic.
