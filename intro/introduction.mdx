# Particle Network Documentation

Particle Network enables **chain abstraction** through **Universal Accounts**, providing users with a unified account and balance for any chain.

In essence, **Universal Accounts** allow users to combine and spend assets from multiple chains, on any destination chain, without bridging. Developers can integrate them directly into any **web application**, making their dApps chain-agnostic by default and accessible to users from any ecosystem.

Whether you're getting started or already familiar with chain abstraction, this documentation helps you:

- Understand **what chain abstraction is and how it works.**
- **Integrate Universal Accounts** into web applications.
