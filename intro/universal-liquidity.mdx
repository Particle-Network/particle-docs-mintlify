# What is Universal Liquidity?

Liquidity today is fragmented across chains, tokens, and user balances.  
Even when accounts are unified, assets themselves generally remain siloed.

**Universal Liquidity** is the core of Particle Network’s chain abstraction, allowing users to **transact anywhere**, even when their tokens exist elsewhere. 

It achieves this through an **intent-based model** applied automatically during transactions.

<Note>
TL;DR: users can spend tokens from one or multiple chains to fund operations on any destination chain. Possible without bridging, swapping, or manual transfers.
</Note>

***

## How It Works

When a transaction requires liquidity on a destination chain where a user holds insufficient tokens, **Universal Liquidity** coordinates an **intent-based settlement** behind the scenes.

1. The user signs a **Merkle root hash** containing:
   * The destination transaction (e.g., swap, mint, deposit)
   * The necessary **operations** that fund it

2. This Merkle root represents a **Merkle tree** of operations, ensuring atomic validation of all steps involved.

3. **Solvers** detect this intent, execute the required operations, and front the necessary tokens on the destination chain.

<Info>

For example, a user wants to execute a transaction that requires **250 USDC on Ethereum**. 

The user holds **100 USDC on Base**, **0.1 BNB on BNB Chain**, and **0.3 SOL on Solana**. 

A solver fronts the required 250 USDC on Ethereum and later receives **repayment** from the user’s balances across those origin chains, plus a small fee.

</Info>

The mechanism operates through **solvers and liquidity sources** distributed across the [supported networks](/universal-accounts/cha/chains).

***

### Gas Abstraction

Users can execute operations without requiring users to hold native gas tokens.  

The Universal infrastructure uses **paymasters** to abstract gas costs, covering fees on the user’s behalf and settling repayment later in any supported token, even across different chains.

This maintains the same cross-chain flexibility as the liquidity layer itself: users can approve and complete complex multi-chain transactions with a single signature, no gas management required.

***

## TL;DR

Universal Liquidity unlocks a **true chain-agnostic user experience**, where:

* Assets across chains act as a **single liquidity source**
* Transactions can be executed **from any combination of balances**
* Users never worry about **bridging, gas, or balance fragmentation**
