# What is Particle Network?

Web3 today is fragmented across hundreds of chains, wallets, and bridges.

Particle Network’s mission is to make **Web3 retail-ready** by solving multi-chain fragmentation and building a user experience that feels as natural as Web2's.

We do this through a stack of products designed to remove friction for both users and developers, unifying Web3 into the way it should be:

- One account.
- One balance.
- Any chain.

## Chain Abstraction

Chain Abstraction is the foundation of Particle Network.
It allows users to interact with any dApp, on any supported chain, using a **single account and unified balance**—without worrying about bridges or network switching.

At the core of this are **Universal Accounts**, which enable:

- **One account, one balance, any chain**: Assets across all chains are automatically combined into one balance.
- **Chain-agnostic UX**: Users can spend tokens from anywhere, on any chain.
- **Universal Gas**: Users can pay fees in any supported token, regardless of the network.

## Social Logins

Onboarding is still one of the biggest blockers in Web3. Particle’s **Social Logins** let users access dApps with credentials they already know — Google, Twitter, Discord, and more — while automatically creating a wallet behind the scenes.

- **One-click onboarding** for mainstream users.
- **Non-custodial** by design, with keys split and secured.
- **Developer-ready SDKs** to add login flows in minutes.

## Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)

Particle also provides infrastructure for **ERC-4337 Account Abstraction**, enabling programmable smart accounts with powerful UX improvements:

- **Gas sponsorship**: Users can transact without holding native gas tokens.
- **Batched transactions**: Bundle multiple actions into a single click.
- **Custom logic**: Recovery flows, spending limits, and more.
