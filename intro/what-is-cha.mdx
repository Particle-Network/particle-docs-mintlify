**Chain abstraction** is "_a user experience exempt from the manual processes required to interact with multiple chains_".

In other words, it refers to eliminating multi-chain friction from users' experience. Particle Network's approach to enabling chain abstraction is **Universal Accounts**, an account-level solution that gives users a unified account and balance across dApps deployed on any chain.

**For developers**, Universal Accounts mean that you can build and deploy dApps on one chain, but serve users from all of them—**without requiring bridging, chain switching, or holding multiple gas tokens**. Instead of forcing users to bridge assets over to the chain(s) your dApp is deployed on, they can instead use a unified **onchain balance** to transact on your dApp.

## Why Chain Abstraction Matters

Currently, Web3 is highly fragmented:

- Users have to manage **multiple balances or wallets** for different chains.
- Each chain has its own **native gas token** (ETH, SOL, BNB, etc.)
- Bridging assets is **complex, time-consuming, and error-prone**.
- dApp developers must redeploy their apps across multiple chains.

Chain abstraction fixes this by shifting complexity away from users and into infrastructure, so users and developers enjoy a consistent experience across the entire ecosystem.

## Key Properties of Universal Accounts' Chain Abstraction

**1. One Account, One Balance, Any Chain**\
Users interact with dApps through a **Universal Account**, with a combined balance across ecosystems.

**2. Unified Liquidity**\
Transactions automatically route liquidity behind the scenes, **removing the need for bridges** or manual swaps.

**3. Universal Gas**\
Users can pay gas fees with **any token** from **any chain**, abstracting away the need to hold native gas tokens.
