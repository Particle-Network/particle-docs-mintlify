**Universal Liquidity** allows **Universal Accounts** to fulfill user actions without requiring them to **bridge** or manually move assets across chains. It routes funds across **solvers** with liquidity on supported networks based on the user’s **intent**, allowing them to interact with all chains as if they were **one**.

---

## How It Works

When a user performs an action on a chain where they don’t hold funds, Universal Liquidity handles the **cross-chain** complexity behind the scenes. **Liquidity sources** and **solvers** operate across networks to execute the transaction.

**Flow:**

1. The user initiates the action (**swap**, **mint**, **deposit**, etc.) and signs once to **authorize** it. No preparation of assets or **gas** on the target chain is required.
2. The **signature** conveys what the user wants to do and confirms they can cover the **cost**.
3. **Solvers** detect the request and temporarily provide the required **liquidity** on the destination chain. They:
   - Execute the transaction on the user’s behalf
   - Cover the required **costs upfront**
   - Recoup the value afterward from the user’s **balances** on any chain
4. The transaction finalizes on the **destination network**.

The user’s funds **never move beforehand**. The solver only fronts the required liquidity, then withdraws **repayment** from the user’s existing balances according to the signed authorization.

A **solver** is simply an **on-chain entity** with liquidity (e.g., an **LP** holding **USDT** or another [**Primary Token**](/universal-accounts/cha/chains)). Particle currently operates the liquidity pools, with the goal of enabling **permissionless** participation in the future.

## Example

A user holds:

- **100 USDC** on Base
- **0.1 BNB** (~$90) on BNB Chain
- **0.3 SOL** (~$40) on Solana

They want to execute a transaction that requires **200 USDC on Ethereum**. A solver provides **200 USDC** on Ethereum and then receives **repayment** across the user’s existing balances, plus a small **fee**.

## Gas Abstraction

Universal Liquidity also removes the requirement to hold **native gas tokens** on every chain. **Paymasters** cover **gas fees** on the user’s behalf, then settle repayment afterward using **any supported asset** — even if that asset is on another chain.

**Flow:**

1. User signs to authorize the operation and **repayment**.
2. **Paymaster** fronts the gas immediately.
3. Transaction executes on the **target chain**.
4. Repayment is deducted afterward using available **balances**.

A **single signature** is enough to complete **cross-chain** operations while advancing both **liquidity** and **gas**.

---

## TL;DR

Universal Liquidity enables:

- Assets across chains to function as **one unified liquidity source**
- Execution of transactions using **any combination** of a user’s balances
- Removal of **bridging**, **gas concerns**, and **balance fragmentation**
