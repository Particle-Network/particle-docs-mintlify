**Universal Accounts** give users one account, balance, and interaction point to use across any chain—EVM or not.

Instead of managing different wallets and bridging tokens to interact with dApps on different chains, users interact through a Universal Account as if the entire Web3 ecosystem were one network. This is possible because Particle Network's underlying infrastructure automatically routes liquidity, bridges assets, and manages cross-chain logic using **Universal Liquidity**.

Developers can integrate Universal Accounts easily into their dApps using the [Universal SDK](/universal-accounts/cha/overview). UAs are compatible with both social logins and wallet connections and support gasless, cross-chain operations out of the box.

# Understanding Universal Accounts

From a technical standpoint, Universal Accounts are smart contract account deployments unified and coordinated by Particle Network's **Universal Liquidity** technology across chains. This enables seamless cross-chain transactions and interactions.

## Key Features

### Chain abstraction

- One account, one balance, any chain.
- Automatic bridging and cross-chain interactions on a per-transaction basis.
- Ability to use multiple gas tokens for different operations.
- Seamless asset transfers across chains.

### Smart Account implementation

- Built on the ERC-4337 standard.
- Compatible with existing EOA wallets.
- Support social login integration.

## How It Works

1. **Integration**
   - Simple SDK implementation, using any EOA as signer.
   - Compatible with existing dApp infrastructure.
2. **Account Creation**
   - Created via social logins or wallet connection.
   - Automatically assigned to a user's EOA.
3. **Cross-Chain Operations**
   - Transactions submitted are funded using a user's collective onchain balance, automatically bridging as needed to fulfill their intent.
   - Gas can be paid using different available tokens.
   - Gasless transactions are available.
