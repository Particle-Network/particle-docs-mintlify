## Understanding `getUserInfo`

- `getUserInfo` retrieves a JSON object containing various data points relating to a registered user (a user that has already undergone social login), such as their name, UUID, token, email, and so on. The population of specific data points (such as `facebookId`, `googleId`, etc.) will be dependent upon their primary associated social account.` It takes:

  - `UUID` - string.

  - `Token` - string.
