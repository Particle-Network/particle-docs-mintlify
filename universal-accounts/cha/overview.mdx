## What is the Universal SDK?

**Universal Accounts** give your users a **single address and balance** across all [supported chains](/universal-accounts/cha/chains).

The **Universal Accounts SDK** allows you to integrate Universal Accounts into your dApp, allowing you to onboard users from any ecosystem without requiring them to bridge—**regardless of where your dApp is deployed**.

---

## Integration Flow

The **Universal Accounts SDK** is designed for fast, minimum-lift integrations with common wallet connection mechanisms.

Under the hood, it utilizes any wallet provider object (e.g., social logins, MetaMask, WalletConnect) and routes all transactions through the user's Universal Account, an ERC-4337 smart account implementation.

In short, the integration flow requires you to:

1. **Configure** the account using a single _config_ object.
2. **Use** your existing _provider_ object (from RainbowKit or any other connection mechanism) using the SDK.
3. Push transactions as usual—no other codebase changes needed. A user's balance of any token will be treated as a collective of these tokens across any chain they're on.

Once integrated, all transactions, balance reads, and gas handling will automatically use the Universal Account—**no additional code for bridging or gas logic required**.

<Note>
  The Universal Accounts SDK uses wallet connection mechanisms. As such, if a user creates a Universal Account by connecting an existing wallet, their assets will not be automatically transferred into the UA. Users can transfer assets into their Universal Account from any supported chain via in-app flows. You may also make Universal Accounts an optional toggle within your dApp if you prefer to maintain EOAs as the default account mechanism.
