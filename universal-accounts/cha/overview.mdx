## What is the Universal SDK?

**Universal Accounts** give your users a **single account and balance** across all [supported chains](/universal-accounts/cha/chains).

The **Universal Accounts SDK** allows you to integrate Universal Accounts into your dApp. This enables you to onboard users from any ecosystem without requiring them to bridge, **regardless of where your dApp is deployed**.

---

## Integration Flow

The **Universal Accounts SDK** makes it simple to integrate chain abstraction into your app with minimal code changes.

Every transaction is routed through Particle’s **Chain Abstraction layer**, so balances and gas are handled across chains automatically.

### Steps to integrate

1. **Initialize** the Universal Account with a single config object.
2. **Construct** and execute transactions using the SDK.
3. **Sign** with your existing provider (e.g. RainbowKit, Particle Auth, or any wallet connector).

That’s it—your current execution flow stays the same. No additional bridging or gas logic required.

<Info>
  The SDK treats the user’s [Primary Assets](/universal-accounts/cha/chains#primary-assets) as a unified balance across all supported chains.
</Info>

### What you get out of the box

- Read balances across chains as if they were one.
- Send transactions without adding bridging logic.
- Gas abstraction automatically handled—no extra code required.

<Note>
  Universal Accounts are **independent smart accounts**, not extensions of an existing wallet.

  - When a user creates a Universal Account with their existing wallet, their assets stay in the original wallet. Nothing is moved automatically.
  - Users can transfer assets into their Universal Account from any supported chain through in-app flows.
  - As a developer, you can choose whether to make Universal Accounts the default experience or keep them as an optional toggle alongside EOAs.
