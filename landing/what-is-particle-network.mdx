# Live Products: Wallet Abstraction

Launched in 2022, Particle Network debuted as a Wallet Abstraction service provider, enabling users to create smart contract wallets linked to their Web2 social accounts. These wallets can be accessed on their own or within dApp-embedded interfaces, and have been widely implemented across the Web3 ecosystem, with over 17 Million wallet activations, 10 Million UserOperations, and 900 dApp integrations.

Particle Network's live Wallet Abstraction product suite consists of two key technologies:

1. Smart Wallet-as-a-Service
2. BTC Connect

### Smart Wallet-as-a-Service

Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service features an application-embedded modal (with the option of being headless) aggregating both social logins and standard wallet connection, acting as an all-in-one mechanism of onboarding users into applications across both EVM-compatible blockchains and Solana.

### BTC Connect

Based on the foundations of Particle Network's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service, BTC Connect is the first account abstraction protocol for the Bitcoin ecosystem, allowing native Bitcoin users to use wallets such as UniSat or Xverse on EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer-2s.

BTC Connect implements ERC-4337 account abstraction throughout the EVM-compatible Bitcoin ecosystem, taking advantage of a Bitcoin-specific smart contract wallet model in which the signer is a Bitcoin account.

# Upcoming Products: Chain Abstraction

## The L1 Unifying All Chains Through Universal Accounts

##### Particle Network's goal is to solve Web3’s fragmentation of users and liquidity across chains.

As an evolution of its Wallet Abstraction products, Particle is taking the next step in its evolution, offering users a borderless Web3 experience through **Universal Accounts, coordinated by the Particle Network L1 blockchain**

## Modular L1

The Particle Network modular L1 blockchain powers chain abstraction by enabling users to have a single address and balance across every chain and pay for gas in any token. It does so by providing the infrastructure that coordinates three core functionalities, each reducing friction for users:

- **Universal Accounts (core chain abstraction product):** Specialized Smart Account implementations powered by Particle Network’s Universal SDK. Users of Universal Accounts have a single address and balance across ecosystems, including EVM networks and heterogeneous blockchains like Bitcoin and Solana. This allows them to seamlessly utilize their assets across all chains without manually bridging.
- **Universal Liquidity:** Unifies the liquidity of all chains through the optimistic execution of multi-chain atomic transactions—essentially, bridging assets for users automatically to fulfill their transactions’ requirements. This allows users to interact with new chains without holding tokens on them.
- **Universal Gas:** Allows users to pay gas with any token (e.g. PARTI, USDT, or USDC) sourced from any blockchain, as opposed to the multi-chain ecosystem’s need for multiple chain-exclusive gas units (SOL, ETH, MATIC, etc.)

The Particle Network L1, responsible exclusively for facilitating the aforementioned functionalities, features a secure, high-performance EVM-compatible execution environment. Relying on the Cosmos SDK to build this chain means the Particle Network L1 retains its sovereignty while being able to outsource key functions like validation and data availability.

Particle Network’s multiple functionalities are driven by Modular Nodes, which help secure the L1 and allow for its decentralized operation through managing transaction validation, data availability, etc.

### Design and security

#### Security and data availability

The Particle Network L1 features a **dual staking system**, combining Proof-of-Stake through Tendermint with Bitcoin’s economic security and resilience, powered by **[Babylon](https://babylonchain.io)**.

Furthermore, it presents a unique data availability aggregation (AggDA) model relying on providers [Celestia](https://celestia.org/), [Avail](https://www.availproject.org/), and [NEAR DA](https://near.org/data-availability) to reduce vendor lock-in and liveness risks. This constitutes a decentralized system of Aggregated DA node operators (a type of Modular Node) to dynamically publish and verify data between providers for conditional redundancy or optimization.
